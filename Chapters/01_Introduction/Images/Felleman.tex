	\caption{Picture adapted from Felleman \& Van Essen (1991) \cite{Felleman1991}. A graphical depiction of cortical regions with structural connections as obtained by post mortem tracer studies. This is also a rudimentary reflection of hierarchical processing in the brain. As these connections originate from target and specific layers, it would be interesting to see if similarities could be found in the layer specific fMRI signal. It could allow making hierarchical statements about neuronal processes based on fMRI data.}
