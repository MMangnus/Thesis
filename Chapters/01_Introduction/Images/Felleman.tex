	\caption{Picture adapted from Felleman \& Van Essen (1991) \cite{Felleman1991}. A graphical depiction of cortical regions with structural connections as obtained by post-mortem tracer studies. This is also a rudimentary reflection of hierarchical processing in the brain. As these connections originate from and target specific layers, it would be interesting to see if similarities can be found in the layer specific fMRI signal. This could allow for making hierarchical statements about neuronal processes based on fMRI data.}
