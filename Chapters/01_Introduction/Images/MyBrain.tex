	\caption{An example of a structural and functional brain scan. On the left, the structural scan has high anatomical contrast and sharp differences between the white matter and grey matter. The contrast is sharp enough to make a three dimensional reconstruction of the brain (lower right corner). On the right, a functional image is shown. The anatomical contrast is much weaker, but it can be acquired quickly and the contrast is susceptible to slight changes in blood deoxyhemoglobin, related to oxygen consumption on neuronal activation.}
