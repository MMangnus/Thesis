	\caption{A schematic illustration of arterial spin labelling (ASL). Small slices are imaged (2 \& 4) with and without tagging the blood upstream in the arteries (1 \& 3). The difference between the two images slices is proportional to the cerebral blood flow (CBF). Image adapted from \cite{UMICH2018}.}
