	\caption{Cortical stainings of the histological layers, taken from Brodmann (1909) \cite{Brodmann1909}. Brodman divided the cortex into regions, based on their differences in laminar structure. There is a wide variety in the thicknesses of the (sub)layers for different properties (nervous tissue, number of cell bodies, myelination), which can be highlighted with different stainings.}
