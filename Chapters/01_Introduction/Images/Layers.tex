	\caption{Cortical stainings of the histological layers, taken from Brodman (1909) \cite{Brodmann1909}. Brodman divided the cortex in regions, based on their differences in laminar structure. There is a wide variety in thickness of the (sub)layers and different properties (nervous tissue, number of cell bodies, myelination) can be highlighted with different staining.}
