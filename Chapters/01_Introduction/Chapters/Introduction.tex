\section*{Neuroimaging}
In order to investigate the workings of the brain, there is a wide variety of tools that give us specific types of information. We can investigate at the micro scale, the level of the individual neuron, or the macro scale, the level of thousands of neurons firing at the same time. But when we zoom in to the micro scale, we can only measure a very small subset of the approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain \cite{Herculano-Houzel2009}. Additionally, if this has to be done in a living animal, this is a very invasive procedure and thus is almost impossible in humans. Macro scale procedures are less invasive and measure electric or magnetic fields outside the brain with electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, it requires thousands of neurons to fire synchronously to pick up such a signal and gives little insight about the spatial location in the brain. Another technique that can image the brain is MRI. While it does not measure neuronal activity directly, and is not as fast as (M/E)EG, it gives highly detailed three dimensional images of the brain. MRI is not nearly specific enough for the micro scale, but may just be able to pick up information from the organisational units that are formed by neurons: the cortical layers and cortical columns. In this thesis, we explore the possibility of using MRI for the meso scale, the intermediate between the neurons and the networks. We push the limits of fMRI analysis to prepare functional MRI (fMRI) for higher spatial resolution, such that we reach the level of the cortical layers (See Figure~\ref{fig:spatiotemporal}). This could teach us more about how neuronal networks communicate with each other and together accomplish complex the tasks of which the brain is capable.

\section*{Cortical layers}
The grey matter of the cortex is a thin shell of approximately 3 mm \cite{Zilles1990} around the white matter. The white matter consists of long fiber tracts that relay signals from one brain area to another, but it is mainly the grey matter where computations are being performed. The grey matter itself consists of several shells as well, cortical layers (see Figure~\ref{fig:layers}), that are likely to have functionally distinct roles.
\input{./Chapters/01_Introduction/Images/Layers}
The specifics of the performed computations are largely unknown, but in general, three types of information can be dissociated according to the predictive coding framework \cite{Friston2010}. At the fundamental level, the brain continuously makes predictions, compares it to (sensory) input, and the difference is called the prediction error. This is a never ending recurrent process of updating knowledge based on new information. The different roles within the predictive coding framework can largely be associated with the cortical layers. In principle, ascending (feedforward, e.g. `I \emph{see} an apple') and descending connections (feedback, e.g. `I \emph{imagine seeing} an apple') are distinguished \cite{Rockland1979} and can be related to hierarchical ranks of processing \cite{Barone2000}. For a given layer $i$ in the hierarchy, it receives feedforward input that target layer 4 and to a lesser extent layer 5 \cite{Constantinople2013} and they predominantly originate from supragranular layers (see Figure~\ref{fig:layerprocessing}). On the other hand, feedback connections from higher areas terminate primarily in layers 1 and 5, but avoid layer 4 \cite{Anderson2009}. The differential contribution is not well established \cite{Shipp2013}. This `canonical microcircuit' describes the excitatory relay of information within the cortex. With its link to the predictive coding, it can provide a more mechanistic understanding of the computations in the brain \cite{Shipp2016}.
\input{./Chapters/01_Introduction/Images/LaminarProcessing}

So the layers contain information about the processing within single region, but may just as well be informative about cross-regional communication. Tracer studies reveal large networks of regions via feedforward and feedback connections \cite{Felleman1991}, see Figure~\ref{fig:felleman}. Tracers heavily rely on (post mortem) structural connectivity, so even though the connections themselves can be mapped out, the strength and nature of connections remains unclear. This is why in vivo investigation of the cortical layers could add new information to the workings of directional and causal communication during task performance. Current work into inter regional causal inference in the brain primarily relies on (disputable) characteristics of haemodynamic consequences of brain interaction in Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) \cite{Friston2009} or timing differences in signals with Granger Causality \cite{Aalen2007} that can further be used to establish cortical hierarchies \cite{Michalareas2016}. The cortical layers may provide the same information of inter regional feedforward and feedback communication in living subjects and could tell more about the crosstalk between regions at the network level. 
\input{./Chapters/01_Introduction/Images/Felleman}

Almost all regions in the brain contain the same types of neurons and a comparable laminar structure. It is therefore fair to assumes that many of the computational underpinnings translate from one brain region to the next \cite{Buonomano1998}. Thus, a better understanding of layer specific processing in one regions and/or process may also teach us more general principles of the brain. For a small set of cognitive tasks one may predict strong feedforward drive, for example when a lot of sensory input is involved. Alternatively, when strong predictions, expectations, or imagination is involved, it is likely to be a feedback process. But is there anything that could constitute as feedforward or feedback when it comes to language processing, remembering, or experiencing emotions? This is largely unknown and to get a better mechanistic understanding it is important to learn more about the laminar processing. 

There is a variety of cognitive function in which layer specific dissociation could already be an interesting tool, as there are clear predictions with respect to feedback and feedforward drive \cite{Lawrence2017}. For example in the area of visual attention, prediction, or saliency, it could be interesting to compare and contrast the different types of hypothesised feedback drive against visual feedforward drive. It may also be used in clinical applications, as some mental disorders are expected to have abnormalities in directional communication between brain regions. Hallucinations and delusions are strongly linked to abnormal perception and are hypothesised to have different predictive coding mechanisms \cite{Fletcher2008}. This may well be reflected in neurophysiological traces of the cortical layers. Other interesting similarities with the brain are found in the emerging field of deep learning networks. Convolutional layers of the networks have been correlated to the visual hierarchy of the brain \cite{Guclu}, and it would be interesting to look for similarities at an even deeper level. Given that deep learning networks work with feedback and feedforward propagation of signals, if these features could be related to the cortical layers as well. 

So signals from the cortical layers in a brain region may contain information about the nature of computations and about communication with other regions. Investigating this during task performance could open doors to new types of information and shed light on a multitude of cognitive processes. However, the greatest barrier is that the layers (and neuronal communication in general) are not easily measured. The most realistic measurement technique to do this is functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, for its high spatial resolution and non-invasiveness. Unfortunately, fMRI only measures a derivative of neuronal firing as changes in oxygen consumption. We will therefore first need to get a better understanding of what type of information it is that fMRI gives us.

\section*{MRI}
The basis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In principle, this describes magnetic behaviour of protons and neutrons in terms of their \emph{quantum spin}: a preferred axis of rotation of an elementary particle. Normally, each spin has a random orientation of the axis of rotation. In the presence of a magnetic field, however, the spins will start precessing around the axis of the main magnetic field. The speed of rotation (angular frequency) will be directly proportional to the magnitude of the field, the Larmor frequency. In 1946, Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell (independently) performed the first experiments in which they manipulated the spins with radio frequency (RF) pulses, for which they later received a Nobel prize. Bloch described the nuclear magnetisation of a material as a function of its relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$ \cite{Bloch1946}. The $T_1$ value describes the time it takes for spins in a certain material to go back to their rest position after they have been excited by an RF pulse for the longitudinal magnetisation (aligned with the magnetic field). The $T_2$ value describes the time in which the transverse magnetisation (perpendicular to the magnetic field) loses the phase coherence between spins. Further development of the measurement technique allowed for a description of these properties as a function of two dimensional space, provided by Paul C. Lauterbur in 1973 \cite{Lauterbur1973}, for which he received a Nobel prize, thirty years later. Initially, this was a much alike the tomographic back projections that form the basis of Computed Tomography (CT). This description formed the basis gradient echo imaging, where an applied magnetic field (gradient) (additional to the main magnetic field) gives rise to a signal from which an image can be reconstructed. A later description was a formalism in which the spatial frequencies of an image, $k$-space, is described as an integral of the gradient \cite{Twieg1983,Ljunggren1983}:
\begin{equation}
\vec{k}(t)=\gamma \int_{0}^{t}\vec{G}(t')dt'
\end{equation}
This is still the basis of current MR imaging. The equation represents the mapping of spatial frequencies in an image as a function of the applied gradient over time. The original simple graphical representation is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:kspace}. If the gradients are applied such that a large part of $k$-space is (homogeneously) covered, the spatial frequencies are accurately sampled. The $k$-space signal is the Fourier transform of the spin density distribution $\rho (\vec{r})$, 
\begin{equation}
S(t)=\hat{\rho}(\vec{k}(t))=\int\rho(\vec{r})e^{i \vec{k}(t) \cdot \vec{r}}d\vec{r},
\end{equation}
such that the $k$-space can easily be transformed into an image of the spin density.
\input{./Chapters/01_Introduction/Images/Kspace}

The aforementioned $T_1$ and $T_2$ mechanisms occur as random processes of spins getting back to a rest equilibrium. There is an additional mechanism, $T_2^*$, in which the dephasing of the spins is not random but predictable, and thus reversible. After an RF pulse, spins start out by pointing in the same direction, but then fan out and start to dephase in clockwise or counter clockwise direction. Hence, the spins will cancel each other out, such that the signal decays much faster than $T_2$, but instead with $T_2^*$. However, their direction can be reversed (by a 180\textdegree RF pulse), such that they start to converge until they point in the same direction again to form a \emph{spin echo}. As a result gradient echo images are $T_2^*$-weighted and spin echo images are $T_2$-weigthed. In general, there is a variety of different acquisition sequences that all target different magnetic properties of the scanned object.

A different contrast is that of Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL) \cite{Williams1992,Detre1994}. In this technique, arterial blood is first `labelled' by means of a 180\textdegree pulse (Figure~\ref{fig:asl}). The labelled blood has different magnetisation and travels downstream where, after an inversion time, the spins in a small area are again inverted by a 180\textdegree pulse. This latter is repeated in a scenario without the initial labelling. The difference in signal must be due to inflow of blood after the original arterial spin labelling. This way, ASL is sensitive to cerebral blood flow (CBF) and can produce perfusion images of the brain \cite{Petcharunpaisan2010}.
\input{./Chapters/01_Introduction/Images/Asl}

Next to cerebral blood \emph{flow}, one can also look at cerbral blood \emph{volume}. Blood vessels may dilate and contract as a function of the activity of a brain region. This can be measured with Vascular Space Occupancy (VASO) \cite{Lu2003}. By selectively nulling the magnetisation of blood and surrounding tissue, their respective contributions can be estimated.
%@David, I tried reading the VASO papers, but I still have absolutely no idea how it works.

\section*{Contrast Mechanisms}
So MRI scanners can be used to obtain a variety of different types of information, but can any of them be informative about the cortical layers? Unfortunately, an MRI scanner cannot measure direct neuronal firing, but there are indirect measures. At the core, all contrasts are results of changes in magnetic properties. All materials have a magnetic \emph{susceptibility}, the extent to which it becomes magnetised by an external magnetic field. If the material resists the magnetic field (i.e. negative susceptibility) it is diamagnetic, and if it assists the field (i.e. positive susceptibility) it is paramagnetic. Certain metals (e.g. iron, nickel, cobalt) have very high susceptibility and are called ferromagnetic. These are the materials that are commonly attracted by standard refrigerator magnets. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin that is paramagnetic when it does not carry oxygen (desoxyhemoglobin) because of the high spin state of the iron atom \cite{Pauling1936}. The change in magnetic susceptibility of red blood cells when they are oxygen rich or oxygen poor is called the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependant Signal, the BOLD signal \cite{Ogawa1990}. So while neuronal firing does not change magnetic properties directly, it indirectly causes changes in blood flow that may be picked up with an MRI scanner. However, large parts of the biological mechanism behind it are still disputed. Most importantly, the extent to which the BOLD response reflects laminar specific activation is largely unknown.

Fundamentally, the BOLD signal arises as a consequence of magnetic field perturbations arising from desoxyhemoglobin molecules \cite{Norris2006}. These changes extend beyond the blood vessel into the tissue and drop off as a function of field strength, the orientation of the vessel, and the vessel diameter as well as the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin. From the time that the molecules are excited until the time of the echo, molecules in the tissue move around the vasculature. If the trajectory of a molecule in this time is small compared to the vessel size (and hence compared to the drop-off), there is little change in its surrounding magnetic field and the effect is reversible, a static effect. If on the other hand the molecule's trajectory is large, its surrounding magnetic field changes more drastically and unpredictably, such that the effect is irreversible and dynamic. These two contrast mechanisms are the static and dynamic extravascular effect. The magnetic field perturbations around the vessels scale linearly with field strength, so the trajectory of a molecule relative to the perturbations is much greater at 7 Tesla than at 1.5 Tesla. Thus, the relative contribution of the dynamic extravascular effect increases with field strength. Specifically, the static effect increases linearly with field strength and the dynamic effect increases quadratically. The remaining static effect at 7 Tesla is thus very specific, but detecting it requires high sensitivity \cite{Panchuelo2014}. 

An additional source of BOLD contrast is the intravascular effect. The magnetic field inside the vessel is slightly different from the surrounding tissue because of the amount of desoxyhemoglobin. As a result, the signal will start to dephase with respect to the extravascular signal. This is can be reversed because it is constant over time and is called the static intravascular effect. The last contrast mechanism that contributes to the BOLD signal is disputed in origin. This is irreversible (dynamic) intravascular dephasing and has to do with the random movement of water molecules within red blood cells. It is either due to these water molecules interacting with the deoxyhemoglobin, or with the diffusion in and out of the cells, but no experiment to date has been able to tease the two mechanisms apart.

%%Good to explain that of four contrast mechanisms two are 'invisible' to SE, and why that is postulated to give better intrinsic spatial resolution at UHF.
Spin echo vs. gradient echo

Even given these four contrast mechanisms, it is still an outstanding question in what proportions they contribute in measurements. This may even vary at the laminar level, as the deoxyhemoglobin from deeper layers flows upward to the top layers. The strengths of these effects have been modelled for both spin echo and gradient echo and suggest that most of the signal produced in a layer is also visible in that layer \cite{Markuerkiaga2016,Uludag2017}. For spin echo the flow effect is minimal, while gradient echo has a tail that extents to more superficial layers, but at a gain of sensitivity. A range of laminar profiles has been found using spin echo (e.g. \cite{Zhao2004,Harel2006,Goense2006}), gradient echo (e.g. \cite{Polimeni2010,DeMartino2013,Chen2013}) or a combination of both, GRadient A Spin Echo (GRASE) \cite{Olman2012,DeMartino2013}.

Figure~\ref{fig:microvasulature} shows the microvasculature of a small piece of visual cortex in a macaque. In red, the arterioles, small blood vessels that dive from the top of the cortex (the pial surface) downward to supply the whole grey matter with blood. The smallest vessels, the capillaries, relay the oxygen to the neurons in all cortical layers, such that deoxygenated hemoglobin is drained away by the veins (blue). The veins on top of the cortex can be an order of magnitude larger than the cortical veins, and accumulate and carry off the deoxygenated blood. This might make one appreciate the difficulty of extracting laminar specific signals with large signals of non-interest in the direct neighbourhood.
\input{./Chapters/01_Introduction/Images/Microvasculature}


But the measure of blood oxygenation itself in turn depends on several factors. More blood starts flowing (higher cerebral blood flow, CBF), vessels start dilating (more cerebral blood volume, CBV) and the consumption of oxygen increases (higher cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, CMRO$_{2}$). These quantitative measures can be related to one another, save some free parameters that need to be empirically determined \cite{Davis1997}. However, the proposed equations hold for the cortical column in its entirety, but do not take into account potential layer specific differences. So while we cannot measure neuronal activation with MRI, the closest we can get is the traces in magnetic properties in the vasculature through BOLD, CBV, CBF, and CMRO$_{2}$. The extent to which these quantities vary as spatially specific as the level of the cortical layers is an outstanding question, however, and needs to empiraclly tested. Indeed, there are techniques to measure them, $T_2^*$-weighted imaging \cite{Norris2006} for BOLD, VASO for CBV \cite{Huber2018}, arterial spin labelling \cite{Grade2015} for CBV, and calibrated BOLD \cite{Blockley2013}) for CMRO$_{2}$. All vary in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and attainable resolution (spatial as well as temporal). The spatial resolution in combination with the type of experiment that is required for CBF and CMRO$_2$ measurements makes them poor candidates for human in vivo fMRI. It is mainly BOLD and CBV that have shown promising layer specific differences in animal experiments \cite{Lu2004,Zhao2006,Jin2008,Goense2012}. The main benefits of VASO compared to BOLD are its quantifiability \cite{Lu2003} and local specificity \cite{Jin2006}, whereas BOLD has higher sensitivity and speed \cite{Huber2018}.


Choosing a sequence requires carefully balancing the advantages and disadvantages against each other. We here chose to use gradient echo to investigate the laminar BOLD signal for its higher sensitivity and at a field strength of 7 Tesla for high specificity. The potential downside of this is the susceptibility to the larger veins on top of the cortex that might obscure smaller effects \cite{Barth2007}. While the exact origins of the BOLD signal are unknown, there is strong evidence that the BOLD signal has a laminar footprint \cite{Logothetis2001}. Although some results from animal studies suggest that the effects may be visible at a higher temporal resolution than human in vivo MRI can achieve \cite{Yu2014,OHerron2016}. With the many uncertainties and the small size of the potential effect, it is clear that any potential effect can only be picked up with powerful methods that address as many sources of noise as possible. 
%%It may be good to discuss some of the characteristics of 3D EPI and also what you can expect at different field strengths as you have looked at both 3T and 7T data.

2D versus 3D acquisition


\section*{Methods}
After covering the fundamentals of measurement techniques, it is clear what types of information may be expected to be present in the data. Getting out the relevant information, however, is at least as complicated. The brain is a highly convoluted structure that we are trying to describe and visualise by means of cubic voxel rasters. The first problem we encounter is a geometrical one: how do we attach a brain location to voxels in space? This can be done by making a \emph{cortical reconstruction} on a high resolution brain scan \cite{Dale1999,Bazin2012} with a very clear contrast between the white matter and grey matter as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mybrain}. The distinction between white and grey matter is clear enough to draw a three dimensional boundary on both side of the grey matter: on the white matter boundary and on the pial surface, the separation between the grey matter and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
\input{./Chapters/01_Introduction/Images/MyBrain}

The cortical reconstruction is very informative about the shape of the brain and potentially also about the layers: One could imagine different layers to be described as intermediate surfaces between both outer boundaries of which the locations can be used to then sample the cortical layers \cite{Koopmans2011,Polimeni2010,DeMartino2013}. This description allows for all sorts of surface based calculations \cite{Fischl2000,Bazin2012} and for example allows us to take into account a more naturalistic flow of the cortical layers \cite{Bok1929,Waehnert2014}. Along the many curves of the cortex, cytoarchitectonic layers approximately conserve volume in a given cortical column. Taking this into account can provide a clear advantage in high resolution laminar analysis.
%%At some point it would be good to describe what the structural scans look like, which contrasts are available, and how they differ from the functional scans. 

The cortical reconstruction can be made on a dedicated high resolution high contrast scan, but this does not yet give functional information. First, the cortical surfaces need to be `coregistered' with the functional data and brought into the same analysis space. Unfortunately, this is made considerably more difficult by two main factors. First, the contrast and resolution of standard gradient echo functional data is poor, so there is not a lot of information on which to base a good coregistration. Secondly, when `echo planar imaging' (EPI) is used, a fast acquisition scheme to collect data, the data will to some extent be geometrically distorted. The reason is that the scanner magnetic field is not everywhere exactly equal. When we talk about a scanner with a field strength of 7 Tesla, it means there should be a stable static magnetic field of that strength in the centre of the scanner. However, because the presence of a human body perturbs the field, it is not as homogeneous as one might desire. Small perturbations can be corrected by \emph{shimming}, applying an additional magnetic field to compensate for the inhomogeneities. However, this is not accurate enough to correct all deviations and the inhomogeneities need not even be constant over time. As mentioned before, MRI is based on spins precessing at a frequency that is proportional to the field strength. If the field is slightly higher or lower, the spins in that area precess slightly faster or slower. It was noted that MRI measures spatial frequencies of an image, assuming a constant magnetic field. So one could imagine that as a direct result of the Fourier shift theorem, spins that precess faster or slower are instead displaced in the resulting image. Since the displacement is field strength dependent, distortions are more pronounced at higher fields. They can easily be of the order of several millimetres, which comes down to a shift of the size of the entire cortex. So extreme care must be taken in aligning scans properly and thoroughly checking the correctness of the cortical surface in the regions that one wants to analyse. %%I think you can improve this explanation, for example why is distortion only along phase-encoding axis. 

There is a wide variety of other potential sources of noise that can contaminate the (laminar) signal. Participants in a study will move several millimetres, breathe and have a heartbeat that is clearly visible in the signal, people may have lapses in their attention, may even fall asleep to the rhythm of the helium pump, et cetera. Many operations are performed on the data to remove as many sources of noise as possible and this creates long analysis pipelines. This makes the process of doing fMRI analysis difficult at the conceptual level, and may also create a logistical nightmare: different software packages, programming languages, data types, data representations, and different styles of programming. As a result, it is understandable that the reproducibility of fMRI results can be low \cite{Nosek2015,Gorgolewski2016a}. We here took care to build and use all tools as reproducibly as possible and to provide all data openly, accompanied with the scripts to generate the results.

\section{Layers Analysis in human FMRI}


pulsation of the brain 

%%%%
In addition, 



There is strong evidence that there are layer specific differences for (sensory) feedforward processes with respect to feedback processes. Indeed, also functionally this seems to reflected in invasive electrical recordings in macaques \cite{Buffalo2011,Maier2010,Maier2011,VanKerkoerle2017}.

While it is known in which layers are intially targeted by feedback and feed foward signals, little is known about their further processing. There is evidence that excitatory neurons may quickly redistribute input from the thalamus by means of their local axonal collaterals \cite{Guy2017,ReyesPuerta2015}. As a result, cortical activity may nearly instantaneously spread over several layers and columns, to the detriment of laminar specificity of the BOLD signal.
This is also reflected in \cite{Yu2015}, where there is a clear layer specificity in the onset of the BOLD response, but does not show any prolonged laminar differentiation.
