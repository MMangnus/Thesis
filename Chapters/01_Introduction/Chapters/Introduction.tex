\section{Neuroimaging}
In order to investigate the workings of the brain, there is a wide variety of tools that gives us specific types of information. We can do investigations on the microscale, the level of the individual neuron, but we can only do this on a very small subset of the approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain \cite{Herculano-Houzel2009}. Additionally, if this has to be done in a living animal, this is a very invasive procedure and thus cannot be done in humans. There are less invasive procedures to measure electric or magnetic fields outside the brain with electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG), but it requires thousands of neurons to fire synchronously to pick up such a signal. Thus, it only yields information about the macro scale of the neuronal firing and gives little insight about the spatial location in the brain. Another technique that can image the brain is MRI. While it does not measure neuronal activity directly, and is not as fast as (M)EEG, it gives highly detailed three dimensional images of the brain. For each method there is a type of information to which it is sensitive, and it measures this at a specific temporal and spatial resolution (See Figure~\ref{fig:spatiotemporal}). Our goal in this thesis was to prepare functional MRI (fMRI) analysis at a bit higher spatial resolution, such that we reach the level of the cortical layers.

\section{MRI}
The basis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In principle, this describes magnetic behaviour of protons and neutrons in terms of their \emph{quantum spin}: a preferred axis of rotation of an elementary particle. In the presence of a magnetic field, the spins will start rotation around the axis of the main magnetic field, and the speed of rotation (angular frequency) will be directly proportional to the magnitude of the field, the Larmor frequency. In 1946, Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell performed the first experiments in which they manipulated the spins with radio frequency (RF) pulses, for which they later received a Nobel prize \cite{Bloch1946}. They described how several magnetic properties of a material could be measured with this method, relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$.
These values describe the time it takes for spins in a certain material to go back to their rest position after they have been excited by an RF pulse for respectively the longitudinal magnetisation (alligned with the magnetic field) and the transverse magnetisation (perpendicular to the magnetic field). 
A further description of a measurement technique that allowed for a description of these properties as a function of two dimensional space was provided by Paul C. Lauterbur in 1973 \cite{Lauterbur1973}, for which he received a Nobel prize, thirty years later. This is still the basis of current MR imaging: a formalism in which the spatial frequencies of an image (\emph{k}-space) can be described as a time integral of an applied magnetic field (gradient), additional to the main magnetic field. This forms the basis for gradient echo pulse sequences. 
The aforementioned $T_1$ and $T_2$ mechanism occurs as a random process of spins getting back to a rest equilibrium. There is an additional mechanism, $T_2^*$, in which the dephasing of the spins is not random but predictable, and thus reversible. After an RF pulse, spins start out by pointing in the same direction, but then fan out by (in equal proportion) starting to dephase in clockwise or counter clockwise direction. Hence, the spins will start cancelling each other out, such that the signal decays with $T_2^*$, which is much faster than $T_2$. However, if their direction is reversed (by a 180\textdegree RF pulse), they start to converge to point in the same direction again to form a spin echo. As a result gradient echo images are $T_2^*$-weighted and spin echo images are $T_2$-weigthed. In general, there is a variety of different acquisition types that all targeted different magnetic properties of the scanned object. 

\section{Cortical layers}
The grey matter of the cortex is a thin shell of approximately 3 mm \cite{Zilles1990} around the white matter. The white matter consists of long fiber tracts that relay signals from one brain area to another, but it is mainly the grey matter where the computations are being performed. The grey matter itself consists of several shells as well, layers, that are likely to have functionally distinct roles, see Figure~\ref{fig:layers}. However, it is largely unknown what these roles are. There is strong evidence that there are layer specific differences for (sensory) feed forward processes (e.g. `I see an apple') with respect to feedback processes (e.g. `I imagine seeing an apple'). Specifically, dissection and staining studies have found that feed forward projections target layer 4 \cite{Felleman1991} and to a lesser extent layer 5 \cite{Constantinople2013} and they predominantly originate from supragranular layers. On the other hand, feedback connections from higher areas terminate primarily in layers 1 and 5, but avoid layer 4 \cite{Felleman1991,Anderson2009}. Indeed, also functionally this seems to reflected in invasive electrical recordings in macaques \cite{Buffalo2011,Maier2010,Maier2011,VanKerkoerle2017}. 
\input{./Chapters/01_Introduction/Images/Layers}

For a small set of experiments, it is relatively straightforward to say if they are feed forward or feedback, but now think of more complicated processes: what would constitute as feed forward in language processing, decision making or memory? This is largely unknown and that is why it is of great interest to learn more about the laminar processing. It could shed light on a multitude of cognitive processes and open doors to a whole new type of information and new research in the brain \cite{Lawrence2017}. However, the greatest barrier is that is neuronal communication is not easily measured. With fMRI, only a derivative of neuronal firing can be measured as changes in oxygen consumption. We will therefore first need to get a better understanding of what type of information it is that fMRI can yield.

\section{Contrast Mechanisms}
Neurons clearly have layer specific functions, but measuring them is not easy, especially not in living humans. We cannot put electrodes in their heads, but what we can do is put them in an MRI scanner. An MRI scanner, however, cannot measure direct neuronal firing. Instead, it is susceptible to all kinds of magnetic properties of which three dimensional images can be made. Most notably, the magnetic susceptibility of red blood cells changes when they are oxygen rich or oxygen poor \cite{Ogawa1990}, which we call the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependant Signal, the BOLD signal. However, while there is little doubt that activation in a cortical region elicits a BOLD response, large parts of the biological mechanism behind it are still disputed. Most importantly, the extent to which the BOLD response reflects laminar specific activation is largely unknown. 

It was noted that maybe more so than just activity (MUA, multi unit acitvity), the amount of synaptic input (measured by the local field potential, LFP) migth be crucial for the strength of the BOLD response \cite{Goense2008}.

\input{./Chapters/01_Introduction/Images/Microvasculature}
Figure~\ref{fig:microvasulature} shows the microvasculature of a small piece of visual cortex in a macaque. In red, the arterioles, small blood vessels that dive from the top of the cortex (the pial surface) downward to supply the whole grey matter from blood. The smallest vessels, the capillaries, relay the oxygen to the neurons in all cortical layers, such that deoxygenated hemoglobin is drained away by the veins (blue). The veins on top of the cortex can be an order of magnitude larger than the cortical veins, and conduct off the deoxygenated blood. This might make one appreciate the difficulty of extracting laminar specific signals with large signals of non-interest in the direct neighbourhood. 

But the level of blood oxygenation is not the only quantity that fluctuates as a result of cortical activation. More blood starts flowing (higher cerebral blood flow, CBF), vessels start dilating (more cerebral blood volume, CBV) and the consumption of oxygen increases (higher cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, CMR$_{O2}$). These quantitative measures can be related to one another by the Davis model, save some free parameters that need to be empirically determined \cite{Davis1997}. However, the proposed equations hold for the cortical column in its entirety, but does not take into account potential layer specific differences. 

So while we cannot measure neuronal activation with MRI, the closest we can get is the traces in the magnetic properties in the vasculature through BOLD, CBV, CBF, and CMRO$_{2}$. The extent to which these quantities vary as spatially specific as the level of the cortical layers is an outstanding question, however, and needs to empiraclly tested. Indeed, there are techniques to measure them, $T_2^*$-weighted imaging \cite{Norris2006} for BOLD, VASO for CBV \cite{Huber2018}, arterial spin labelling \cite{Grade2015} for CBV, and calibrated BOLD \cite{Blockley2013}) for CMRO$_{2}$. All vary in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and attainable resolution (spatial as well as temporal). The spatial resolution in combination with the type of experiment that is required for CBF and CMRO$_2$ measurements makes them poor candidates for human in vivo fMRI. It is mainly BOLD and CBV that have shown promising layer specific differences in animal experiments \cite{Lu2004,Zhao2006,Jin2008,Goense2012}. The main benefits of VASO compared to BOLD are its quantifiability \cite{Lu2003} and local specificity \cite{Jin2006}, whereas BOLD has higher sensitivity and speed \cite{Huber2018}.

Our main goal was to investigate the possibilities of laminar analysis in standard experiments on humans, and hence chose to use the BOLD signal as our signal of interest. Fundamentally, the BOLD signal arises as a consequence of magnetic field perturbations arising from desoxyhemoglobin molecules \cite{Norris2006}. These changes extend beyond the blood vessel and drop off as a function of field strength, the orientation of the vessel, and the vessel diameter. 
From the time that the molecules are excited until the time of the echo, molecules move around through the vessel. If the trajectory of a molecule in this time is small compared to the vessel size (and hence compared to the drop-off), there is little change in its surrounding magnetic field and the effect is reversible, a static effect. If on the other hand the molecule's trajectory is large, its surrounding magnetic field changes more drastically and unpredictably, such that the effect is irreversible and dynamic.
These two contrast mechanisms are the static and dynamic extravascular effect
The magnetic field perturbations scale linearly with field strength, so the trajectory of a molecule relative to the perturbations is much greater at 7 Tesla than at 1.5 Tesla. Thus, the dynamic extravascular effect increase with field strength. 
The remaining static effect at 7 Tesla is thus very specific, but detecting it requires high sensitivity \cite{Panchuelo2014}. 
An additional source of BOLD contrast is the intravascular effect. The magnetic field inside the vessel is slightly different from the surrounding tissue because of the amount of desoxyhemoglobin. As a result, the signal will start to dephase with respect to the extravascular signal. This is can be reversed because it is constant over time and is called the static intravascular effect. The exact origin of the last contrast mechanism is unclear. This is irreversible (dynamic) intravascular dephasing and has to do with the random movement of water molecules within red blood cells. It is either due to these water molecules interacting with the deoxyhemoglobin, or with the diffusion in and out of the cells, but no experiment to date has been able to tease the two mechanisms apart.
Four different contrast mechanisms can be distinguished.

Even given these four contrast mechanisms, it is still an outstanding question in what proportions they proliferate in measurements. This may even vary at the laminar level, as the deoxyhemoglobin from deeper layers flows upward to the top layers. The strengths of these effects have been modelled \cite{Markuerkiaga2016,Uludag2017} for both spin echo and gradient echo and suggest that most of the signal produced in a layer is also visible in that layer. For spin echo this is almost fully the case, while gradient echo has a tail that extents to more superficial layers, but at a gain of sensitivity. A range of laminar profiles has been found using spin echo (e.g. \cite{Zhao2004,Harel2006,Goense2006}), gradient echo (e.g. \cite{Polimeni2010,DeMartino2013,Chen2013}) or a combination of both, GRadient A Spin Echo (GRASE) \cite{Olman2012,DeMartino2013}.

Choosing a sequence requires carefully balancing the advantages and disadvantages against each other. We here chose to use gradient echo to investigate the laminar BOLD signal for its higher sensitivity at a field strength of 7 Tesla for high specificity. The potential downside of this is the susceptibility to the larger veins on top of the cortex that might obscure smaller effects \cite{Barth2007}. While the exact origins of the BOLD signal are unknown, there is strong evidence that the BOLD signal has a laminar footprint \cite{Logothetis2001}. Although some results from animal studies suggest that the effects may be visible at a higher temporal resolution than human in vivo MRI can achieve \cite{Yu2014,OHerron2016}. With the many uncertainties and the small size of the potential effect, it is soon clear that any potential effect can only be picked up with powerful methods that address as many sources of noise as possible. 

\subsection{Methods}
After covering the fundamentals of measurement techniques, it is clear what types of information may be expected to be present in the data. Getting out the relevant information, however, is at least as complicated. The brain is a highly convoluted structure that we are trying to describe and visualise by means of cubic voxel rasters. The first problem we encounter is a geometrical one: how do we attach a brain location to voxels in space? This can be done by making a \emph{cortical reconstruction} on a high resolution brain scan \cite{Dale1999,Bazin2012} with a very clear contrast between the white matter and grey matter as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mybrain}. The distinction between white and grey matter is clear enough to draw a three dimensional boundary on both side of the grey matter: on the white matter boundary and one on the pial surface, the separation between the grey matter and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
\input{./Chapters/01_Introduction/Images/MyBrain}

The cortical reconstruction is very informative about the shape of the brain and potentially also about the layers: One could imagine different layers to be described as intermediate surfaces between both outer boundaries of which the locations can be used to then sample the cortical layers \cite{Koopmans2011,Polimeni2010,DeMartino2013}.
This descriptions allows for all sorts of surface base calculations \cite{Fischl2000,Bazin2012} and for example allows us to take into account a more naturalistic flow of the cortical layers \cite{Bok1929,Waehnertr2014}. Here it is described

The scanner 


When we talk about a scanner with a field strength of 7 Tesla, it means there should be a homogeneous static magnetic field of that strength in the centre of the scanner. However, because the presence of a human body perturbs the field, it is not as homogeneous as one might want. Small perturbations can be corrected by \emph{shimming}, applying an additional magnetic field to compensate for the inhomogeneities. However, this is not accurate enough to correct all deviations and the inhomogeneities need not be constant over time.
