This is the part of the book where I would like to thank everyone who has helped me throughout my PhD trajectory, and without whom this thesis simply would not have existed. If you opened this book just to read this section and not any of the other interesting parts, I see you and forgive you :$)$ I hope you enjoy reading about all the people in my academic and personal life to whom I am incredibly grateful.

Als eerst wil ik graag alle \textbf{deelnemers aan mijn studie} bedanken, met name alle autistische en sociaal angstige deelnemers. Het is nogal wat om mee te doen met een MRI-experiment of EEG-experiment van een hele dag en op vreemde onderzoekers te moeten vertrouwen dat het allemaal goed gaat. Ik ben dankbaar voor jullie moed en doorzettingsvermogen om mee te doen met deze studie, en ik hoop dat het onderzoek in dit proefschrift een belangrijke bijdrage kan dienen aan het begrijpen van autisme en sociale angst. 

I would like to thank my team of supervisors, who have supported me in all the different ways a PhD student needs to be supported and stimulated. \newline 
\textbf{Jana}, I don't think I can express my gratitude for you in words, but I will try. Our one-on-one discussions on our results, analyses and what they might mean, were some of my favorite moments during the past six years. Your fascination with pragmatics is contagious and I will keep it with me for the rest of my life. You kept me motivated during the most difficult period of my life and I always felt supported and understood by you. Thank you for all the help along on the way. \newline
\textbf{Arjen}, thank you for all the critical questions, feedback and stimulating discussions over the years. Your input always helped elevate the quality of my papers and experiments to a higher level. Your inquisitive attitude is inspiring and I am encouraged to keep up with your research on mutual understanding in the future. \newline
\textbf{Peter}, your level-headedness and ability to ask exactly the right questions at the right time were very important to the progress in my PhD. I am grateful for your honesty, your focus on finishing the thesis and your nudges to keep me in the right direction. I feel very lucky to have had you as my promotor. 

Between my work and the MPI and the Donders, I have had the chance to work with many wonderful, inspiring and cooperative colleagues. I would like to thank all of you for making my job so much more fun and my research better. \newline
\textbf{Saskia}, I feel like it would be just as fitting to address you in the supervisors section. Over the past years we worked so closely together and I have learned so much from you, that you truly feel like my honorary supervisor. Statistics, coding in R/Matlab, experiment design, fMRI analysis: you helped me become proficient in all of these with your continuous support and assistance. Even for the more mentally challenging parts of the PhD, you were there to listen and offer your advice. I could not have wished for a better postdoc to have had alongside me on this Synergy journey. \newline
\textbf{Ashley}, thank you so much for teaching me all about EEG and signal analysis in the last leg of my PhD. I had a lot of fun learning so much about a topic that was new to me and really enjoyed all of our discussions. I feel like, in your work, you strike the perfect balance between scientific rigor and efficacy and I aspire to do the same in the future. I'm happy to know that many students in Hong Kong will benefit from your excellent supervision. \newline
\textbf{Miriam}, it has been very inspiring to collaborate with you, your endless passion for communication, and your tendency to keep asking questions. We spent so much time coding the behavioral responses of the movie questionnaire, I wonder if anyone in the history of mankind have been better experts on what exactly a mental state word is or not. I'm very grateful for the time and effort you spent on our project, and had a lot of fun working on it with you! \newline
\textbf{Maartje}, thank you so very much for spearheading the participant recruitment and planning of experiment sessions. Our project was so logistically difficult that I am amazed we pulled it off to have collected all the data. I am so happy for the effort you put into the Synergy project and to have profited off your patience, decisiveness and thinking on your feet. \newline
\textbf{Franziska}, it was so fun to be able to chat and collaborate with you on the pupillometry analysis! Thank you for all your preprocessing work on the pupillometry data, the improvements in the analysis pipeline, and the lovely conversations and cups of tea and coffee we shared. \newline
\textbf{Ivan}, thank you for the useful feedback on all of my presentations, posters, and papers. Having an extra professor in my team, and a critical one such as yourself, has been very helpful in improving my work and my thinking. \newline
\textbf{Simon}, for the relatively brief period that you were in Nijmegen, I appreciate the comments and discussions we had during and outside of the Synergy meetings about my research. Thank you for this, as well as being great company during the INSAR conference in Stockholm. \newline
\textbf{Daniela}, I had a great time digging into fMRI analysis with you and really enjoyed all of our nerdy conversations about movies during the scanning sessions. \newline
\textbf{Robin}, thank you for all the work you put in the Synergy project and the Social Anxiety study. I am very proud of the paper and hope the journal we submitted it to will recognize this too. I had a lot of fun working with you on the study and am excited to see you flourish in your career. \newline
Thank you \textbf{Sophia}, \textbf{Christine}, and \textbf{Mirthe} for running the MRI and EEG experiments together. We were working as a well-oiled participant scanning machine by the end and I have all of your problem solving abilities to thank for that. \newline
\textbf{Kexin}, you seemed to put all of your attention and energy in everything you set your mind to. Because of that, I am very grateful that my research happened to be of your interest. From the moment you joined the Synergy lab, I was in awe about how fast you picked up on the details of the Synergy study. With the same dedication and insight, you developed an eyetracking analysis pipeline with Arjen, which helped me immensely for my thesis. You were also always on top of the EEG testing sessions and really effortless to collaborate with. I can't imagine this thesis without your help and will always be grateful to have been able to met you and work with you. \newline
Thanks to all the \textbf{NBL members} for the insightful presentations, discussions, and your useful feedback when I had a chance to present my work. I'd also like to thank all of the \textbf{NBL PhDs} for your critical feedback and offering a listening ear. \textbf{Sophie}, thank you for all the productivity meetings and cups of coffee at the height of the pandemic, it helped keep me sane. \textbf{Laura}, thank you for all the advice and insights I needed when finishing up the PhD. A special thanks to rest of the \textbf{NBL Social Committee}, Ashley, Laura, and M\"{u}ge, I really enjoyed the drinks and events we organized together. 
Thank you to all of the PhDs and Postdocs in \textbf{Language in Interaction} for the good company during the retreats. I'd like to thank \textbf{Elena} and \textbf{Marlou} in particular for the useful and fun writing sessions. \newline
To all of my office mates: thank you for both the quick chats and the deep conversations. There have been too many of you too many to name, but just know that you made my day-to-day life a lot more fun and enjoyable. \newline
Thank you \textbf{Annemiek Barsingerhorn} for our conversations and your guidance when I lost track of what was important in the PhD. You helped me a lot in getting out of a difficult spot in my life. \newline
Lastly, I want to thank \textbf{Alexandra Elbakyan} for helping researchers around the world to get the necessary information to do their work.
