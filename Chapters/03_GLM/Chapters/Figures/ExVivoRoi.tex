\caption{The layering, the regions of interest, and the extracted cortical profiles for three regions. While all three methods perform almost identically, there are small oscillations present in the profiles as produced by the GLM. Especially in the top layer, the peak is potentially mistakenly higher than both other methods suggest.}
