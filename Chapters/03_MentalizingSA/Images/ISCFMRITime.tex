	\caption{Dynamic intersubject correlation analysis identified three spatiotemporal brain clusters that exhibited differences in brain response variability between socially anxious and control participants. In Clusters 1 and 2, socially anxious participants exhibited lower correlations, indicative of heightened variability, across extended intervals of the film. Conversely, Cluster 3 showed consistently reduced variability among socially anxious participants throughout the film. Solid lines depict moments of significant variability within the clusters, while dashed lines represent moments of non-significant variability.}
