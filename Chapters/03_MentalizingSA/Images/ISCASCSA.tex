	\caption{(a) Overlay of brain correlation Cluster 1, showing heightened variability in socially anxious individuals, with a previously identified cluster that exhibits reduced variability in autistic individuals during the same film. The overlap constitutes 60\% of the total cluster size. (b) Temporal dynamics within the overlapping voxels reveal the most significant divergence during the initial two-thirds of the film.}
