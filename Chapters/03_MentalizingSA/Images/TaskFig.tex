	\caption{Socially anxious participants and matched controls viewed the animated short 'Partly Cloudy', which portrays the developing friendship and interactions between a stork and a cloud. During the viewing, participants' pupil responses, brain activity, and heart rates were continuously recorded. The film is annotated to highlight three distinct event types: Mental, Pain and Control, each marked on the film's timeline. Mental events are expected to engage viewers' mentalizing, prompting them to infer the character' thoughts and emotions. Pain events illustrate the characters experiencing physical discomfort, while Control events feature only passive or background imagery. The images displayed were generated using Bing's Copilot to closely replicate scenes from the film, adhering to copyright constraints.}
