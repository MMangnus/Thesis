	\caption{(a) Brain regions with significant activation during Mental events as compared to Control and Pain events. (b) Control participants showed greater activation in the left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) than socially anxious participants across both mentalizing contrasts. (c) Region of Interest (ROI) analyses underscore the distinct role of the left pSTS within the mentalizing network in differentiating socially anxious participants from controls. This distinction is supported by a significant correlation between reduced activation in this region and higher levels of social anxiety, as measured by the LSAS.}
