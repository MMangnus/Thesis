	\caption{(a) Word clouds illustrate the frequency of mental state-related words used by socially anxious and control participants in their movie descriptions. The size of each word is scaled according to its frequency. (b) Proportion of mental state-related words relative to other content words, with no significant differences observed between groups. (c) Proportion of words expressing negative emotions compared to other emotion words, showing a lower incidence of negatively charged words among socially anxious participants relative to controls. (d) Pupil responses across all event types and participants groups, with significant differences between event types marked by asterisks (**\textit{p} < .001, *\textit{p} < .01) and no significant differences between groups. Outliers are represented by dots, while whiskers extend to a 1.5 inter-quartile range.}
