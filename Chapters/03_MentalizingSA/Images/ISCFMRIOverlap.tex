	\caption{Overlay of the three brain correlation clusters with activation maps from scenes depicting mental state scenes. Each cluster showed modest spatial overlap with the mentalizing network, with none of the overlaps exceeding 30\% of their respective cluster sizes. For enhanced clarity, clusters are visualized using a cumulative \textit{t}-value threshold of 20 or higher.}
