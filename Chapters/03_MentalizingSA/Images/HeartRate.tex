	\caption{(a) Mean heart rate measured across the duration of the movie for both socially anxious and control participants. Adjacent histograms show the aggregated mean heart rate throughout the entire film for each group, with error bars representing 95\% confidence intervals. (b) Average intersubject correlation coefficients illustrate the intersubject variability in heart rate response during the movie among socially anxious and control participants. There were no significant differences detected in either metric between the two groups.}
