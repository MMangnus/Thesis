	\caption{Schematic of the task performed by autistic and neurotypical participants during the EEG experiment to ensure a close reading of the sequences. Sentences (shown here) or pseudoword lists were presented by showing every word or pseudoword consecutively for 400 ms, preceded by a fixation cross for 200 ms. After each sequence, participants were asked whether a target word (here: \textit{station}), on screen for 750 ms, was shown in the sequence they had just read, which they indicated via button press.}
