	\caption{Time-frequency (TF) power across the trial time course in the sentences and pseudoword lists for both groups. Power values are shown for the peak electrode in the sentences vs. pseudoword list contrast of the frequency band, of which the location is shown with scalp topography. Power differences over time between the two conditions were detected in the theta, alpha and beta band. No significant changes of TF power over time were found between autistic and neurotypical for any frequency band. Error bars indicate standard error. SENT = Sentences, LIST = Pseudoword lists. ** = \textit{p} < .001, * = \textit{p} < .01}
