	\caption{Lateralization of time-frequency power in the sentences vs. pseudoword lists contrast detected across the hemisphere. Comparisons against zero showed significantly lower lateralization for autistic participants in the alpha band, driven by lateral electrodes. No significant changes of lateralization found between autistic and neurotypical for any frequency band. ** = \textit{p} < .01}
