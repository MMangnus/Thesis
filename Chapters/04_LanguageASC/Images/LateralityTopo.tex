	\caption{Lateralization of time-frequency power in the sentences vs. pseudoword lists contrast detected across the hemisphere. Comparisons against zero showed significantly lower lateralization for all participants in the alpha and beta band, and for autistic participants in the alpha band. Both effects were driven by lateral electrodes. No significant changes of lateralization found between autistic and neurotypical for any frequency band. * = \textit{p} < .05, ** = \textit{p} < .01, *** = \textit{p} < .001}
