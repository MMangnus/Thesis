	\caption{Lateralization across the trial time course of time-frequency power in the sentences vs. pseudoword lists contrast for both groups. Laterality indices are shown averaged over the four peak channels of the experimental contrast. The location of the channels is shown in the topography for each frequency band. No significant changes of lateralization over time were found between autistic and neurotypical for any frequency band. Additionally, no significant change of laterlization over time was detected in the linear regression fits. Error bars indicate standard error. }
