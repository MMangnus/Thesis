	\caption{Comparable neural activation patterns during mental state events across groups. (a) Brain sections showing whole-brain responses specific to mental state events, as assessed through the Mental > Control and Mental > Pain contrasts. There were no significant differences in activation for either contrast between the autistic and neurotypical groups. (b) Box plots depicting the contrast estimates for the Mental > Control (in blue) and Mental > Pain (in red) comparisons across various Regions of Interest (ROI) for both groups. rTPJ and mPFC were selected as ROIs based on mentalizing literature, while the precuneus was selected because of the peak voxel being located in that region for both mentalizing contrasts. Across all ROIs and contrasts, no significant differences were observed between the groups. Outliers are represented by dots, while whiskers display a 1.5 inter-quartile range.}
