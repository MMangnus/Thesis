	\caption{Comparable mental state descriptions and pupil responses across groups. (a) Word Cloud depicting the frequency of mental state-related vocabulary used by participants in their post-viewing movie descriptions. The size of each word corresponds to its frequency of use. (b) Bar graphs displaying the ratio of mental state words to other content-related terms in these descriptions, showing no significant differences between the two groups. (c) Pupil responses across all event conditions, revealing similar response patterns in both autistic and neurotypical groups. Asterisks denote significant differences between event conditions (all \textit{p} < .001), with no significant differences observed between groups. Outliers are represented by dots, while whiskers display a 1.5 inter-quartile range.}
