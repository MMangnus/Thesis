	\caption{Reduced pupil response variability in autistic participants. Dynamic intersubject correlation analysis initially showed comparably high levels of correlation in both autistic and neurotypical groups at the start of the movie. However, a significant divergence emerged around the 40-second mark, where autistic individuals showed stronger correlations in their pupil responses, indicating reduced intersubject variability, compared to neurotypical participants. This pattern of reduced variability emerged well before the mental state events highlighted in red. Solid lines delineate statistically significant intervals, as determined by a cluster-based permutation test.}
