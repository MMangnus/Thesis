	\caption{Autistic and neurotypical participants viewed a six-minute animated movie portraying the evolving friendship between a stork and a cloud, while their pupil and brain responses were recorded. Originally used by Jacoby et al. (2016) as a mentalizing localizer, the movie includes three types of events: Mental, Pain and Control, each marked on the movie timeline. Mental and Pain events were expected to prompt inferences about characters' mental and physical states, whereas Control events featured no characters in the foreground. The event images shown were generated using Copilot in Bing for copyright purposes to closely resemble scenes from the movie.}
