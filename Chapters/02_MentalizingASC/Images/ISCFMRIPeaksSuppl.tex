	\caption{Brain response variability across four key regions, including the right and left supramarginal gyrus (rSMG; lSMG), the right inferior temporal gyrus (rITG), and the left calcarine gyrus (lCG). \textit{T}-values were extracted from a 30 mm diameter sphere centered on the peak voxel. Variability in all four regions was statistically significant throughout most of the movie duration.}
