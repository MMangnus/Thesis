	\caption{Limited spatial overlap between brain regions showing reduced intersubject variability in autistic participants and mentalizing activation. The overlap comprised less than 20\% of the total cluster size. For clarity, the cluster is visualized using a cumulative \textit{t}-value threshold of 20 or higher. Lateral brain images provide an overlay with a search distance of 10 mm. }
