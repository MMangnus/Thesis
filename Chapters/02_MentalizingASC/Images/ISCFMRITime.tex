	\caption{Reduced brain response variability in autistic participants. Dynamic intersubject correlation analysis identified a spatiotemporal brain cluster where autistic individuals demonstrated significantly stronger correlations in their brain responses, indicating reduced intersubject variability, compared to neurotypical participants. This cluster persisted throughout the movie and featured peaks in the right and left supramarginal gyrus, the right inferior temporal gyrus, and the left calcarine gyrus. Echoing the pupillometry data, this pattern of reduced variability in autistic participants emerged well before the mental state events highlighted in red. LH, left hemisphere; RH, right hemisphere.}
