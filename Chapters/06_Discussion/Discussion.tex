For long the nature of the processing undertaken by the cortical layers has been recognised as a mystery that needs to be resolved to better understand the computations being performed by our brains \cite{Miller2001}. The most realistic method to date of studying this in living human subjects is with functional MRI, as it it very precise and non invasive. But many challenges in spatial and temporal resolution, resolution, interpretation, and all sorts of noise have to be overcome before this can be easily used to solve neuropsychological problems. The objective of this thesis was to pave the way for doing more routine laminar fMRI analysis. Indeed we made significant steps towards this end. 
We have developed several new methods that solve major problems in laminar analysis, we conducted a full layer specific analysis, and took explicit care to make everything along the way reproducible and reusable. %% <-- unpack

\section*{Chapter 2: Recursive Boundary Registration}
First, we addressed the problem of local distortions that are often present in Echo Planar Images (EPI). Due to inhomogeneities in the main magnetic field, spins in some areas rotate a bit faster or slower than others. Effectively, this causes small shifts of parts of the image with respect to the true position. Thus, even though the true locations of the layers are known, the distortions may easily be larger than the thickness of the layers. Without correcting this effect it is hopeless to get out any reliable layer signal. So that is what we set out to do in Chapter 2.

Geometry transformation from one volume to the other (coregistration) has been very succesful for linear transformations and is used routinely in fMRI analysis. Even on volumes with low resolution, low contrast, or few slices, it may work well \cite{Greve201}, but not for non-linear transformations. Such transformations require a high number of degrees of freedom because of the many parameters that need to be estimated. This leaves much more room for error and therefore usually only works on high contrast data sets. It is used routinely for transforming single subject anatomical space to a template space with the same contrast. However, existing techniques are not powerful enough to undistort low contrast EPI images. We therefore invented a new technique for this, Recursive Boundary Registration. By recursively applying linear transformations on diminishing spatial scales, we effectively compute a non linear registration. In order to guarantee smoothness over all transformations, it is combined with a control point lattice that regulates the transformations. Explicitly taking the geometry of the volume into account as a type of prior knowledge is a novel way to approach non linear registrations.

We tested RBR on two different types of data. First, in order to establish a gold standard, we distorted a FLASH image that is typically without distortion. Because we did this in a controlled manner, we could easily compare the performance of RBR to our ground truth and verify the quality of the registration. We thus proceeded to EPI data set of 11 subjects that had real distortions. As the true size of the distortions was unknown there cannot be an absolute quality metric for the registration. Instead, by adding different levels of noise we showed that there is a clear SNR dependance in the displacement that decreases towards the no-noise condition. Additionally, we provide an abundance of graphical evidence to illustrate the performance of RBR.

The power of the method lies in the fact that it makes explicit use of the gyrification of the brain and the specific geometry of an individual brain. It can therefore get away with little contrast and still produce an accurate registration while preserving the topology of the original. Because of the large number of parameters that needs to be estimated we built in a variety of robustness assurances. Despite the overall improved registration, it is still important to carefully inspect the quality of the registration to verify the required submillimetre accuracy. All in all, this proved to be a valuable tool for preparing Gradient Echo images for subsequent analyses and we use it in our experimental study in Chapter 4. It is now an integral part of the fMRI analysis toolbox for laminar fMRI, \url{https://github.com/TimVanMourik/OpenFmriAnalysis}.

An helpful realisation in developing this method was a more conceptual look on the problem. The problem of coregistration can be classified along two main axes: the type of image contrast can be different or the same, and the required transformation can be linear or non linear. The easiest scenario is to find a linear transformation for a volume with similar contrast. The problem becomes harder when the volume has a different contrast, as the mapping of intensity values from one volume to the next is unknown. If instead the contrast is the same but the required transformation is non linear, it is still solvable to a good approximation \cite{Collins1995}. However, when the contrast is different \emph{and} the registration should be non-linear the, the degrees of freedom of the problem increases drastically, and is not easily estimated anymore. Combine this with the low contrast-to-noise ratio of fMRI data and it is clear that this is a hopeless endeavour with standard volume-to-volume registration. The trick to solve this conundrum is to introduce more prior knowledge to the equation. In this case, we chose to use the geometric information of the cortex and its many gyri and sulci to more accurately estimate a non linear cross-modal registration. This does the trick on a single subject level, but by introducing prior knowledge, we restricted the use cases. Where the previous non-linear transforms could also compute subject-to-template registration, we lost this ability by strictly enforcing equal geometry across volumes. As a general notion, algorithms can become more powerful when they are more specialised. Usually this requires a specific type of prior knowledge in the data that is quantified and optimised.

\section*{Chapter 3: Spatial GLM for laminar fMRI}
Once the geometry of our cortical surfaces is properly aligned with our functional data, there is a next problem: how can the laminar signal be extracted from the MRI volume? There are several intuitive ways. A volume could simply be interpolated at the approximate location of the layers, or classify voxels to be part of it most likely layer. However, it is clear that this inherently smears out the laminar signal to some extent. In Chapter 3 we set out to quantify this signal leakage and to present a new method to reduces it and to more cleanly separate the laminar signal.

We started out with the notion that all voxels are a mixture of a variety of layers. If this mixture could be accurately modeled it could theoretically also be inverted and solved for the layer intensity values by means of the framework of the General Linear Model (GLM). To achieve this, we first set up a mathematical framework to accurately model the layer distribution and subsequently estimate the layer signal intensity. Our cortex model incorporates information about the precise location, curvature and thickness of the cortex and we suggested taking into account the noise correlation of the volume in the estimation procedure. Interestingly, we found a way to describe existing procedures in the same mathematical framework of the laminar spatial GLM. This allowed for an easy comparison between all method in the subsequent validation.

In validating the performance of all methods, we used several different types of data. In order to see if in principle the method would perform better when all assumptions are met, we spent considerable effort to make an accurate simulation of the cortex. By modeling known properties about the curvature into the gyri and sulci of the cortex, we constructed a gold standard of an MRI volume. This allowed for a very clean comparison of the different methods in ideal circumstances. As predicted, extracting the laminar signal by means of a spatial GLM considerably reduced the signal leakage to neighbouring layers. We then investigated the performance of all methods on two types of functional data: a high resolution (post mortem) piece of cortex to get a large number of cortical layers, and a set of in vivo human structural scans to gauge the viability of the method in human MRI data. We found largely similar behaviours between methods, but also a disturbing kind of artifact in the spatial GLM profiles: an oscillating pattern that gets stronger mainly when the cortex is divided into more layers. But the performance and the strength of the ringing artifact also depends on a vast parameter set that would be interesting to investigate, amongst which the volume's spatial resolution, noise level, noise type, the presence or absence of veins and intensity gradients, et cetera. Investigating the combination of all these factors would create a combinatoric explosion, so we carefully chose a subset and presented the comparative results. 

We previously mentioned that methods can become more powerful when they use types of prior knowledge inherent to the data. We here find that as an important addition we need to add that it might come at the cost of a high susceptibility to cases where the assumptions are violated. The fact that artifacts appear in the profile for the spatial GLM may well be interpreted as inaccurate boundary placement or the presence of unknown types of noise. In that case, it is not only a problem for the GLM, but for laminar analysis in general. We thus stress again the importance of carefully inspecting one's data before proceeding to making laminar inferences. 

\section*{Chapter 4: Layer Specificity in Visual Attention}
With the data prepared for high resolution accuracy with Recursive Boundary Registration, and with a way to extract laminar signals with the spatial GLM, the way has been paved to conduct an experimental study. In this chapter, we investigate the laminar underpinning of visual attention. A lot is known about the visual system, also in terms of laminar processing, so it is an ideal test scenario for an initial laminar investigation. In general, visual input first goes to the thalamus and thalamo-cortical connections primarily target layer IV in the visual cortex. In contrast, layers I-II and VI are typically implicated in receiving downward information flow (feedback) in a process like attention. We thus investigated if the BOLD signal indeed shows a laminar differentiation in feedback and feed forward signals. 

We set up an experiment in which we balanced visual input and attentional input in an orientation discrimination task. We conducted this at high field, 7 Tesla, for higher sensitivity and submillimeter resolution and took explicit care to remove as many sources of noise as possible. We corrected the distortions in the volume with RBR; filtered out heartbeat and respiratory noise with RETROICOR; established regions of interest from a dedicated retinotopic session; had a higher number of subject, a more powerful statistical design and performed more rigorous statistical tests than ever conducted in a laminar study; looked at three regions of interest of the visual hierarchy (V1, V2, V3), and performed numerous control analyses. Despite all this, we found no evidence for layer specific differentiation in the BOLD signal. 

While we do find activation for feed forward and feedback stimuli, the cortical activation profiles are not statistically different. In line with previous findings, feed back (attentional) activation increases towards higher visual areas, whereas feed forward (visual) activation decreases \cite{Murray2008,Jehee2011}. Additionally, there is a steady increase towards the superficial layers. This has frequently been observed and has two main potential reasons \cite{Koopmans2010,Polimeni2010}. The blood flows from deep layers to superficial layers and may cause a BOLD carry-over effect. Alternatively, the pial surface has large draining veins to which gradient echo is sensitive that may leak signal into lower layers as a methodological artifact. The lack of layer specific differentiation is hard to be interpreted. When an experiment yields a null results, there is a variety of potential reasons that cannot easily be distinguished. They can be separated into three categories: methodological, neurophysiological, and statistical. 

As mentioned throughout this thesis, exceedingly precise measurements are required for structures as small as the cortical layers. Along the way of data analysis, many methodological challenges were resolved, but we cannot exclude there to be e.g. residual structural misalignments due to cortical reconstruction or registration inaccuracies, dynamic misalignments due to movement or cardiac pulsation of the brain. Additionally, because of the limits of the acquisition we made compromises and the price we paid for a high spatial resolution and sensitivity was a low SNR per voxel, and reduced specificity as a result of draining veins on top of the cortex. Other choices may have revealed more signal or reduced the amount of noise. Methodological issues that are not sufficiently addressed may in the worst case lead to a bias in the results, and in the best case increase the noise surrounding the effect. If there is a true effect, it will only count as statistically significant if the average effect is stronger than the sources of noise that are inherently present in any measurement. We reduced the sources of noise to and tried to increase the signal by scanning a larger number of participants than customary for laminar studies, N=17 (cf. N=6 in \cite{Polimeni2010}, N=4 in \cite{Muckli2015}, N=10 in \cite{Kok2016}). Nonetheless, the signal term may still be small. Neurophysiologically, it is uncertain if targeted layers have a large effect on the laminar BOLD signal. While feed forward and feedback signals preferentially target specific layers, the signal may nearly instantaneously spread to other layers. On top of that, the neurovascular coupling does not guarantee that this is uniquely visible in the respective layer. An alternative explanation could be that our attentional modulation is fundamentally different from other cognitive capacities that have shown positive laminar differentiation, such as figure-ground segregation \cite{Kok2015} or other non-classical receptive field effects \cite{Muckli2015}. 

In general, it is hard to specificy the reason behind a null result, but it is interesting to put it in a broader perspective and compare it to other positive results in the literature. Given the difficulty of the analysis, the small effects, and the large number of sources of noise, one might expect many publication with laminar null results. However, nothing could be further from the truth. To date, no paper exists that specifies to have looked for laminar differentiation but found none. %rather bold statement, but please prove me otherwise.
It is not hard to understand why this is. It is difficult to interpret negative results because after all, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The space of possibilities by which a study can yield negative results is a lot larger than by which it can yield positive results. It is thus a lot harder to know what to conclude from a negative result than from a positive result, and such papers will find an easier path to publication. But as understandable as this may be, it will undoubtedly keep some papers of similar quality in the file drawer, depending on their outcomes. Therefore, the state of the literature does not necessarily provide an accurate reflection of all scientific work. A critical reflection on this publication bias might be a welcome addition to the literature.
