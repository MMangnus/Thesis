It is well-known that directing spatial attention towards a particular stimulus enhances cortical responses at corresponding regions in cortex. How attention modulates the laminar response profile within the attended region, however, remains unclear. In this paper, we use high field (7T) fMRI to investigate the effects of attention on laminar activity profiles in areas V1-V3; both when a stimulus was presented to the observer, and in the absence of visual stimulation. Replicating previous findings, we find robust increases in the overall BOLD response for attended regions in cortex, both with and without visual stimulation. Interestingly, when analyzing the BOLD response across the individual layers in visual cortex, we observed no evidence for laminar-specific differentiation with attention. We offer several potential explanations for these results, including theoretical, methodological and technical reasons.
