\caption{Layer-specific amplitude of the BOLD response in the experiment in areas V1-V3. Circles indicate when a grating was presented, squares depict when no grating was presented, at either the attended (red) or unattended (blue) location. When a stimulus was presented, activation reliably increased towards the pial surface. Attention significantly enhanced the BOLD response across all layers. Error bars indicate $\pm$1 SEM.}
