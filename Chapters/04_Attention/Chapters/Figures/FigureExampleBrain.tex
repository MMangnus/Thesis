\caption{Example of Regions of interest on the inflated cortical surface for a representative subject. The label contours from top to bottom show dorsal V3, V2, and V1 and ventral V1, V2, and V3, in both hemispheres. The 600 most activated vertices (highlighted) per region where selected for the main analysis, the 300 and 900 vertices for control analyses in order to show that the effects are independent of size of region of interest.}
