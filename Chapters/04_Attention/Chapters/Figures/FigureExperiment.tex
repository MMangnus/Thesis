\caption{Stimuli and experimental procedure. Example of a trial sequence from the experiment. Subjects fixated a central bull's eye target while gratings of independent orientation ($\pm$ 45\textdegree) appeared in each hemifield. A compound black/white cue indicated whether subjects should attend to the left or right stimuli; in this example, the white circle indicates `attend right.' Subjects had to discriminate near-threshold changes in orientation of the attended grating with respect to the closest diagonal. In one-third of trials, no stimuli appeared at either location. Red circles depict the attended location and were not present in the actual display.}
