\caption{The mid slice of the registration performed on a manually distorted FLASH image (red boundaries). The registered surface (yellow) overlaps for the larger part of the brain almost perfectly with the gold standard (green). If the specificity is set to high values, there is a risk that errors start to appear in some low contrast regions. This largely depends on the balance between false positives and false negatives in terms of corrected regions.}
