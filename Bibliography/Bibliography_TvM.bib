  abstract  = {Recent years have seen an increase in alarming signals regarding the lack of replicability in neuroscience, psychology, and other related fields. To avoid a widespread crisis in neuroimaging research and consequent loss of credibility in the public eye, we need to improve how we do science. This article aims to be a practical guide for researchers at any stage of their careers that will help them make their research more reproducible and transparent while minimizing the additional effort that this might require. The guide covers three major topics in open science (data, code, and publications) and offers practical advice as well as highlighting advantages of adopting more open research practices that go beyond improved transparency and reproducibility.},

  abstract = {The default mode network (DMN), based in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), exhibits higher metabolic activity at rest than during performance of externally-oriented cognitive tasks. Recent studies have suggested that competitive relationships between the DMN and various task-positive networks involved in task performance are intrinsically represented in the brain in the form of strong negative correlations (anticorrelations) between spontaneous fluctuations in these networks. Most neuroimaging studies characterize the DMN as a homogenous network, thus few have examined the differential contributions of DMN components to such competitive relationships. Here we examined functional differentiation within the default mode network, with an emphasis on understanding competitive relationships between this and other networks. We used a seed correlation approach on resting-state data to assess differences in functional connectivity between these two regions and their anticorrelated networks. While the positively correlated networks for the vmPFC and PCC seeds largely overlapped, the anticorrelated networks for each showed striking differences. Activity in vmPFC negatively predicted activity in parietal visual spatial and temporal attention networks, whereas activity in PCC negatively predicted activity in prefrontal-based motor control circuits. Granger causality analyses suggest that vmPFC and PCC exert greater influence on their anticorrelated networks than the other way around, suggesting that these two default mode nodes may directly modulate activity in task-positive networks. Thus, the two major nodes comprising the default mode network are differentiated with respect to the specific brain systems with which they interact, suggesting greater heterogeneity within this network than is commonly appreciated.},

Although sensory afferents certainly establish the basic receptive field properties of thalamic neurons, increasing evidence indicates that feedback from the cortex plays a crucial role in shaping thalamic responses. Here, we review recent work on the corticothalamic pathways associated with the visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that sensory responses of thalamic neurons result from dynamic interactions between feedforward and feedback pathways.},

  abstract = {Even after realignment there is residual movement-related variance present in fMRI time-series, causing loss of sensitivity and, potentially, also specificity. One cause is the differential deformation of the sampling matrix, by field inhomogeneities, at different object positions, i.e., a movement-by-inhomogeneity interaction. This has been addressed previously by using empirical field measurements. In the present paper we suggest a forward model of how data is affected by an inhomogeneous field at different object positions. From this model we derive a method to solve the inverse problem of estimating the field inhomogeneities and their derivatives with respect to object position, directly from the \{EPI\} data and estimated realignment parameters. The field is modeled as a linear combination of cosine basis fields, which facilitates a fast way of implementing the necessary matrix operations. Simulations suggest that the solution is tractable and that the fields are estimable given the deformed images and knowledge of the relative positions at which they have been acquired. An experiment on a subject performing voluntary movements in the scanner yielded plausible estimates of the deformation fields and their application to ?unwarp? the time series significantly reduced movement-related variance. },

  abstract = {Summary The influence of attention on visual cortical neurons has been described in terms of its effect on the structure of receptive fields (RFs), where multiple stimuli compete to drive neural responses and ultimately behavior. We stimulated the frontal eye field (FEF) of passively fixating monkeys and produced changes in \{V4\} responses similar to known effects of voluntary attention. Subthreshold \{FEF\} stimulation enhanced visual responses at particular locations within the \{RF\} and altered the interaction between pairs of \{RF\} stimuli to favor those aligned with the activated \{FEF\} site. Thus, we could influence which stimulus drove the responses of individual \{V4\} neurons. These results suggest that spatial signals involved in saccade preparation are used to covertly select among multiple stimuli appearing within the \{RFs\} of visual cortical neurons. },

  abstract = {The work presented herein describes our methods and results for predicting, measuring and correcting geometric distortions in a 3 T clinical magnetic resonance (MR) scanner for the purpose of image guidance in radiation treatment planning. Geometric inaccuracies due to both inhomogeneities in the background field and nonlinearities in the applied gradients were easily visualized on the MR images of a regularly structured three-dimensional (3D) grid phantom. From a computed tomography scan, the locations of just under 10 000 control points within the phantom were accurately determined in three dimensions using a MATLAB-based computer program. MR distortion was then determined by measuring the corresponding locations of the control points when the phantom was imaged using the MR scanner. Using a reversed gradient method, distortions due to gradient nonlinearities were separated from distortions due to inhomogeneities in the background B0 field. Because the various sources of machine-related distortions can be individually characterized, distortions present in other imaging sequences (for which 3D distortion cannot accurately be measured using phantom methods) can be predicted negating the need for individual distortion calculation for a variety of other imaging sequences. Distortions were found to be primarily caused by gradient nonlinearities and maximum image distortions were reported to be less than those previously found by other researchers at 1.5 T. Finally, the image slices were corrected for distortion in order to provide geometrically accurate phantom images.},

  abstract = {The ability to image the cortex laminar arrangements in vivo is one of the holy grails of neuroscience. Recent studies have visualized the cortical layers ex vivo and in vivo (on a small region of interest) using high-resolution T(1)/T(2) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we used inversion-recovery (IR) MRI to increase the sensitivity of MRI toward cortical architecture and achieving whole-brain characterization of the layers, in vivo, in 3D on humans and rats. Using the IR measurements, we computed 3D signal intensity plots along the cortex termed corticograms to characterize cortical substructures. We found that cluster analyses of the multi-IR images along the cortex divides it into at least 6 laminar compartments. To validate our observations, we compared the IR-MRI analysis with histology and revealed a correspondence, although these 2 measures do not represent similar quantities. The abilities of the method to segment the cortex into layers were demonstrated on the striate cortex (visualizing the stripe of Gennari) and on the frontal cortex. We conclude that the presented methodology can serve as means to study and characterize individual cortical architecture and organization.},

  abstract = {This article discusses general modeling of multisubject and/or multisession \{FMRI\} data. In particular, we show that a two-level mixed-effects model (where parameters of interest at the group level are estimated from parameter and variance estimates from the single-session level) can be made equivalent to a single complete mixed-effects model (where parameters of interest at the group level are estimated directly from all of the original single sessions' time series data) if the (co-)variance at the second level is set equal to the sum of the (co-)variances in the single-level form, using the \{BLUE\} with known covariances. This result has significant implications for group studies in FMRI, since it shows that the group analysis requires only values of the parameter estimates and their (co-)variance from the first level, generalizing the well-established ?summary statistics? approach in FMRI. The simple and generalized framework allows different prewhitening and different first-level regressors to be used for each subject. The framework incorporates multiple levels and cases such as repeated measures, paired or unpaired t tests and F tests at the group level; explicit examples of such models are given in the article. Using numerical simulations based on typical first-level covariance structures from real \{FMRI\} data we demonstrate that by taking into account lower-level covariances and heterogeneity a substantial increase in higher-level Z score is possible. },

Image quality and contrast between gray and white matter were superior with the MP RAGE sequence compared with the T1-weighted SE sequence. The time for obtaining contiguous thin-section (1.3-2.5-mm) images was also comparable, with readily acquired multiplanar reformations obviating additional images. MP RAGE imaging depicted more focal lesions than did T1-weighted SE imaging and matched the number seen with T2-weighted SE imaging. Demonstration of paramagnetic contrast enhancement of lesions was comparable in most cases; however, three lesions showed greater enhancement on T1-weighted SE images and two others were seen only on the T1-weighted SE images.

  abstract  = {Explicit segmentation is required for many forms of quantitative neuroanatomic analysis. However, manual methods are time-consuming and subject to errors in both accuracy and reproducibility (precision). A 3-D model-based segmentation method is presented in this paper for the completely automatic identification and delineation of gross anatomical structures of the human brain based on their appearance in magnetic resonance images (MRI).The approach depends on a general, iterative, hierarchical non-linear registration procedure and a 3-D digital model of human brain anatomy that contains both volumetric intensity-based data and a geometric atlas. Here, the traditional segmentation strategy is inverted: instead of matching geometric contours from and idealized atlas directly to the MRI data, segmentation is achieved by identifying the non-linear spatial transformation that best maps corresponding intensity-based features between a model image and a new MRI brain volume. When completed, atlas contours defined on the model image are mapped through the same transformation to segment and label individual structures in the new data set.Using manually segmented sturcture boundaries for comparison, measures of volumetric difference and volumetric overlap were less than 2% and better than 97% for realistic brain phantom data, and less than 10% and better than 85%, respectively, for human MRI data. This compares favorably to intra-observer variability estimates of 4.9% and 87%, respectively. The procedure performs well, is objective and its implementation robust. The procedure requires no manual intervention, and is thus applicable to studies of large numbers of subjects. The general method for non-linear image matching is also useful for non-linear mapping of brain data sets into stereotaxic space if the target volume is already in stereotaxic space. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In order to study such cortical properties in humans, it is necessary to obtain an accurate and explicit representation of the cortical surface in individual subjects. Here we describe a set of automated procedures for obtaining accurate reconstructions of the cortical surface, which have been applied to data from more than 100 subjects, requiring little or no manual intervention. Automated routines for unfolding and flattening the cortical surface are described in a companion paper.

A key advantage brought by ultra-high field MRI is the possibility to increase the spatial resolution at which data is acquired, with little reduction in image quality. This opens a new set of opportunities for neuroscience, allowing investigators to map the human cortex at an unprecedented level of detail. In this review, we present recent work that capitalizes on the increased signal-to-noise ratio available at ultra-high field and discuss the theoretical advances with a focus on sensory and motor systems neuroscience. Further, we review research performed at sub-millimeter spatial resolution and discuss the limits and the potential of ultra-high field imaging for structural and functional imaging in human cortex. The increased spatial resolution achievable at ultra-high field has the potential to unveil the fundamental computations performed within a given cortical area, ultimately allowing the visualization of the mesoscopic organization of human cortex at the functional and structural level.},

We measured the fMRI signal caused by this stimulus in visual cortex and represented the results on images of the flattened cortical sheet. We used the method to locate visual areas and to evaluate the spatial precision of fMRI. Specifically, we: (i) identified the borders between several retinotopically organized visual areas in the posterior occipital lobe; (ii) measured the function relating cortical position to visual field eccentricity within area V1; (iii) localized activity to within 1.1 mm of visual cortex; and (iv) estimated the spatial resolution of the fMRI signal and found that signal amplitude falls to 60% at a spatial frequency of 1 cycle per 9 mm of visual cortex. This spatial resolution is consistent with a linespread whose full width at half maximum spreads across 3.5 mm of visual cortex.},

  abstract = {Accurate and automated methods for measuring the thickness of human cerebral cortex could provide powerful tools for diagnosing and studying a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Manual methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data are labor intensive, requiring several days of effort by a trained anatomist. Furthermore, the highly folded nature of the cortex is problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular to any of the cardinal axes. As a consequence, it has been impractical to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual subjects, or group statistics for patient or control populations. Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects. The reliability and accuracy of this new method are assessed by within-subject test-retest studies, as well as by comparison of cross-subject regional thickness measures with published values.},

Data from non-human primate histology shows that connections between lower to higher areas (e.g. retina?V1), and between higher to lower areas (e.g. V1?V2) can be dissociated based upon the distribution of afferent synapses at the laminar level. Ultra-high field scanners opened up the possibility to image brain structure and function at an unprecedented level of detail. Taking advantage of the increased spatial resolution available, it could theoretically be possible to disentangle activity from different cortical depths from human cerebral cortex, separately studying different compartments across depth. Here we use half-millimeter human functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, MRI) to derive laminar profiles in early visual cortex using a paradigm known to elicit two separate responses originating from an excitatory and a suppressive source, avoiding any contamination due to blood-stealing. We report the shape of laminar blood level oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) profiles from the excitatory and suppressive conditions. We analyse positive and negative %BOLD laminar profiles with respect to the dominating linear trend towards the pial surface, a confounding feature of gradient echo \{BOLD\} fMRI, and examine the correspondence with the anatomical landmark of input-related signals in primary visual cortex, the stria of Gennari. },

  abstract = {Abstract The human cerebral cortex is characterized by a number of features that are not uniformly distributed, such as the presence of multiple cytoarchitectonic elements and of myelinated layers running tangentially to the cortex surface. The presence and absence of these features are the basis of the parcellation of the cerebral cortex in several areas. A number of areas show myelin increases localized within the cortex, e.g., the stria of Gennari located in layer IV of the primary visual cortex. Sub-millimeter MRI can resolve myelin variations across the human cortex and may allow in vivo parcellation of these brain areas. Here, we image within-area myelination. We modified a T1-weighted (T1-w) MPRAGE sequence to enhance myelin visualization within the cortex. First, we acquired images from an ex vivo sample, and compared MRI laminar profiles from calcarine (corresponding to primary visual cortex) and extra-calcarine areas with histology sections from the same locations. Laminar profiles between myelin stained sections and the T1-w images were similar both in calcarine as well as extra-calcarine cortex. In calcarine cortex, the profile reveals the stria of Gennari. In extra-calcarine cortex, a similar profile exists which we suggest corresponds to the lines of Baillarger. Next, we adapted the same sequence to image within-area myelination in vivo. Also in in vivo data, we discriminated similar laminar profiles in calcarine and extra-calcarine cortex, extending into parietal and frontal lobes. We argue that this myelin pattern outside the calcarine cortex represents the lines of Baillarger.},

In the sense that these examples are all special cases of the general linear model it should be possible to implement them (and many others) within a unified framework. We present here a general approach that accomodates most forms of experimental layout and ensuing analysis (designed experiments with fixed effects for factors, covariates and interaction of factors). This approach brings together two well established bodies of theory (the general linear model and the theory of Gaussian fields) to provide a complete and simple framework for the analysis of imaging data.The importance of this framework is twofold: (i) Conceptual and mathematical simplicity, in that the same small number of operational equations is used irrespective of the complexity of the experiment or nature of the statistical model and (ii) the generality of the framework provides for great latitude in experimental design and analysis. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were obtained from 10 postmortem brains. The brains were serially sectioned at 20 ?m, sections were stained for cell bodies, and areas 3a, 3b, and 1 were defined with an observer-independent cytoarchitectonic technique. After correction of the sections for deformations due to histological processing, the 3-D reconstructed histological volumes of the individual brains and the volume representations of the cytoarchitectonic areas were adapted to the reference brain of a computerized atlas. Corresponding areas were superimposed in the 3-D space of the reference brain. These population maps describe, for each voxel, how many brains have a representation of one particular cytoarchitectonic area. Each area?s extent is very variable across different brains, but representations of areas 3a, 3b, and 1 in ?50% of the brains were found in the fundus of the central sulcus, its caudal bank, and on the crown of the postcentral gyrus, respectively. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were defined for each area in which ?50% of the brains have a representation of that area. Despite close spatial relationship of areas 3a, 3b, and 1 in the postcentral gyrus, the three \{VOIs\} overlap by &lt;1% of their volumes. Functional imaging data can now be brought into the same standard anatomical format, and changes in regional cerebral blood flow can be calculated in \{VOIs\} of areas 3a, 3b, and 1, which are derived from genuine cytoarchitectonic data. },

A simple image-based correction method is described that does not have the limitations of k-space methods that preclude high spatial frequency correction. Low-order Fourier series are fit to the image data based on time of each image acquisition relative to the phase of the cardiac and respiratory cycles, monitored using a photoplethysmograph and pneumatic belt, respectively. The RETROICOR method is demonstrated using resting-state experiments on three subjects and compared with the k-space method. The method is found to perform well for both respiration- and cardiac-induced noise without imposing spatial filtering on the correction. Magn Reson Med 44:162-167, 2000.},

  abstract = {Abstract BrainVoyager started as a simple fMRI analysis tool in the mid 1990s; the software was primarily created to fulfill the needs of its author and his colleagues to analyze anatomical and functional MRI data in a way that would be most appropriate for their research questions in visual and auditory perception. More specifically, the software was designed with three major goals in mind. First, it should allow analyses that would exploit optimally the high-resolution information available in fMRI data. Second, it should integrate volume-based analysis and cortex-based analysis including the possibility to visualize topographic activation data on flattened cortex representations. Third, it should combine hypothesis testing with data-driven analysis including interactive visualization tools that would make it as easy as possible to look at and explore data. A fourth guiding principle was to develop a software package that fulfilled the author's preference for elegant user interfaces, beautiful visualizations and high-performance computing. These major guiding principles from the beginning of BrainVoyager development are still noticeable in the most recent incarnations of the software that has grown from a small fMRI analysis tool on the Windows platform to a comprehensive cross-platform multi-modal software package integrating (real-time) fMRI, DWI/DTI, (i)EEG, MEG, TMS and fNIRS analyses.},

  abstract = {Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity to analyze their data in different ways, with different underlying assumptions. Several sophisticated software packages (e.g., AFNI, BrainVoyager, FSL, FreeSurfer, Nipy, R, SPM) are used to process and analyze large and often diverse (highly multi-dimensional) data. However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: 1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; 2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; 3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; 4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and 5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional scripting. Nipype is BSD licensed, allowing anyone unrestricted usage. An open, community-driven development philosophy allows the software to quickly adapt and address the varied needs of the evolving neuroimaging community, especially in the context of increasing demand for reproducible research.},

There are thousands MRI studies performed every year generating a substantial amount of data. At the same time, many new data analysis methods are being developed every year. The potential of using new analysis methods on the variety of existing and newly acquired data is hindered by difficulties in software deployment and lack of support for standardized input data. Here we propose to use container technology to make deployment of a wide range of data analysis techniques easy. In addition, we adapt the existing data analysis tools to interface with data organized in a standardized way. We hope that this approach will enable researchers to access a wider range of methods when analyzing their data which will lead to accelerated progress in human neuroscience.},

While many algorithms to register image pairs from the same subject exist, visual inspection shows that their accuracy and robustness to be suspect, particularly when there are strong intensity gradients and/or only part of the brain is imaged. This paper introduces a new algorithm called Boundary-Based Registration, or BBR. The novelty of \{BBR\} is that it treats the two images very differently. The reference image must be of sufficient resolution and quality to extract surfaces that separate tissue types. The input image is then aligned to the reference by maximizing the intensity gradient across tissue boundaries. Several lower quality images can be aligned through their alignment with the reference. Visual inspection and fMRI results show that \{BBR\} is more accurate than correlation ratio or normalized mutual information and is considerably more robust to even strong intensity inhomogeneities. \{BBR\} also excels at aligning partial-brain images to whole-brain images, a domain in which existing registration algorithms frequently fail. Even in the limit of registering a single slice, we show the \{BBR\} results to be robust and accurate. },

The technique takes advantage of excitation pulses with small flip angles eliminating the need of waiting periods in between successive experiments. It is based on the acquisition of the free induction decay in the form of a gradient echo generated by reversal of the read gradient. The entire imaging time is only given by the number of projections desired times the duration of slice selection and data acquisition. The method results in about a 100-fold reduction in measuring time without sacrificing spatial resolution. Further advantages are an optimized signal-to-noise ratio, the applicability of commercial gradient systems, and the deposition of extremely low rf power. FLASH imaging is demonstrated on phantoms, animals, and human extremities using a 2.3 T 40 cm bore magnet system. 1H NMR images are obtained with variable relaxation time contrasts and without motional artifacts.},

  abstract = {Abstract Cortical layer-dependent high (sub-millimeter) resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in human or animal brain can be used to address questions regarding the functioning of cortical circuits, such as the effect of different afferent and efferent connectivities on activity in specific cortical layers. The sensitivity of gradient echo (GE) blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses to large draining veins reduces its local specificity and can render the interpretation of the underlying laminar neural activity impossible. The application of the more spatially specific cerebral blood volume (CBV)-based fMRI in humans has been hindered by the low sensitivity of the noninvasive modalities available. Here, a vascular space occupancy (VASO) variant, adapted for use at high field, is further optimized to capture layer-dependent activity changes in human motor cortex at sub-millimeter resolution. Acquired activation maps and cortical profiles show that the \{VASO\} signal peaks in gray matter at 0.8?1.6 mm depth, and deeper compared to the superficial and vein-dominated GE-BOLD responses. Validation of the \{VASO\} signal change versus well-established iron-oxide contrast agent based fMRI methods in animals showed the same cortical profiles of \{CBV\} change, after normalization for lamina-dependent baseline CBV. In order to evaluate its potential of revealing small lamina-dependent signal differences due to modulations of the input-output characteristics, layer-dependent \{VASO\} responses were investigated in the ipsilateral hemisphere during unilateral finger tapping. Positive activation in ipsilateral primary motor cortex and negative activation in ipsilateral primary sensory cortex were observed. This feature is only visible in high-resolution fMRI where opposing sides of a sulcus can be investigated independently because of a lack of partial volume effects. Based on the results presented here, we conclude that \{VASO\} offers good reproducibility, high sensitivity and lower sensitivity than GE-BOLD to changes in larger vessels, making it a valuable tool for layer-dependent fMRI studies in humans. },

  abstract = {A well-recognized problem with the echo-planar imaging (EPI) technique most commonly used for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies is geometric distortion caused by magnetic field inhomogeneity. This makes it difficult to achieve an accurate registration between a functional activation map calculated from an \{EPI\} time series and an undistorted, high resolution anatomical image. A correction method based on mapping the spatial distribution of field inhomogeneities can be used to reduce these distortions. This approach is attractive in its simplicity but requires postprocessing to improve the robustness of the acquired field map and reduce any secondary artifacts. Furthermore, the distribution of the internal magnetic field throughout the head is position dependent resulting in an interaction between distortion and head motion. Therefore, a single field map may not be sufficient to correct for the distortions throughout a whole fMRI time series. In this paper we present a quantitative evaluation of image distortion correction for fMRI at 2T. We assess (i) methods for the acquisition and calculation of field maps, (ii) the effect of image distortion correction on the coregistration between anatomical and functional images, and (iii) the interaction between distortion and head motion, assessing the feasibility of using field maps to reduce this effect. We propose that field maps with acceptable noise levels can be generated easily using a dual echo-time \{EPI\} sequence and demonstrate the importance of distortion correction for anatomical coregistration, even for small distortions. Using a dual echo-time series to generate a unique field map at each time point, we characterize the interaction between head motion and geometric distortion. However, we suggest that the variance between successively measured field maps introduces additional unwanted variance in the voxel time-series and is therefore not adequate to correct for time-varying distortions. },

Does this attentional increase in activity indicate improved processing of all features contained within the attended stimulus, or might spatial attention selectively enhance the features relevant to the observer's task? We used fMRI decoding methods to measure the strength of orientation-selective activity patterns in the human visual cortex while subjects performed either an orientation or contrast discrimination task, involving one of two laterally presented gratings. Greater overall BOLD activation with spatial attention was observed in visual cortical areas V1-V4 for both tasks. However, multivariate pattern analysis revealed that orientation-selective responses were enhanced by attention only when orientation was the task-relevant feature and not when the contrast of the grating had to be attended. In a second experiment, observers discriminated the orientation or color of a specific lateral grating. Here, orientation-selective responses were enhanced in both tasks, but color-selective responses were enhanced only when color was task relevant. In both experiments, task-specific enhancement of feature-selective activity was not confined to the attended stimulus location but instead spread to other locations in the visual field, suggesting the concurrent involvement of a global feature-based attentional mechanism. These results suggest that attention can be remarkably selective in its ability to enhance particular task-relevant features and further reveal that increases in overall BOLD amplitude are not necessarily accompanied by improved processing of stimulus information.},

Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global?local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods. },

This paper examines the assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary implementation details is included as this is an important part of any practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal, inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently available registration packages in common usage.},

Past theories have relied on the intralaminar nuclei as the sources of diffuse thalamocortical projections that could facilitate spread of activity across the cortex. A case is made for the presence of a matrix of superficially-projecting cells, not confined to the intralaminar nuclei but extending throughout the whole thalamus. These cells are distinguished by immunoreactivity for the calcium-binding protein, \{D28K\} calbindin, are found in all thalamic nuclei of primates and have increased numbers in some nuclei. They project to superficial layers of the cerebral cortex over relatively wide areas, unconstrained by architectonic boundaries. They generally receive subcortical inputs that lack the topographic order and physiological precision of the principal sensory pathways. Superimposed upon the matrix in certain nuclei only, is a core of cells distinguished by immunoreactivity for another calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin, These project in highly ordered fashion to middle layers of the cortex in an area-specific manner. They are innervated by subcortical inputs that are topographically precise and have readily identifiable physiological properties. The parvalbumin cells form the basis for sensory and other inputs that are to be used as a basis for perception. The calbindin cells, especially when recruited by corticothalamic connections, can form a basis for the engagement of multiple cortical areas and thalamic nuclei that is essential for the binding of multiple aspects of sensory experience into a single framework of consciousness. },

We investigated whether the perception of edge orientation, a fundamental visual feature, can be decoded from human brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using statistical algorithms to classify brain states, we found that ensemble fMRI signals in early visual areas could reliably predict on individual trials which of eight stimulus orientations the subject was seeing. Moreover, when subjects had to attend to one of two overlapping orthogonal gratings, feature-based attention strongly biased ensemble activity toward the attended orientation. These results demonstrate that fMRI activity patterns in early visual areas, including primary visual cortex (V1), contain detailed orientation information that can reliably predict subjective perception. Our approach provides a framework for the readout of fine-tuned representations in the human brain and their subjective contents.},

  abstract = {Abstract Functional MRI at ultra-high magnetic fields ($\gt$ 7T) provides the opportunity to probe columnar and laminar processing in the human brain in vivo at sub-millimeter spatial scales. However, fMRI data only indirectly reflects the neuronal laminar profile due to a bias to ascending and pial veins inherent in gradient- and spin-echo BOLD fMRI. In addition, accurate delineation of the cortical depths is difficult, due to the relatively large voxel sizes and lack of sufficient tissue contrast in the functional images. In conventional depth-dependent fMRI studies, anatomical and functional data are acquired with different image read-out modules, the fMRI data are distortion-corrected and vascular biases are accounted for by subtracting the depth-dependent activation profiles of different stimulus conditions. In this study, using high-resolution gradient-echo fMRI data (0.7 mm isotropic) of the human visual cortex, we propose instead, that depth-dependent functional information is best preserved if data analysis is performed in the original functional data space. To achieve this, we acquired anatomical images with high tissue contrast and similar distortion to the functional images using multiple inversion-recovery time EPI, thereby eliminating the need to un-distort the fMRI data. We demonstrate higher spatial accuracy for the cortical layer definitions of this approach as compared to the more conventional approach using MP2RAGE anatomy. In addition, we provide theoretical arguments and empirical evidence that vascular biases can be better accounted for using division instead of subtraction of the depth-dependent profiles. Finally, we show that the hemodynamic response of grey matter has relatively stronger post-stimulus undershoot than the pial vein voxels. In summary, we show that the choice of fMRI data acquisition and processing can impact observable differences in the cortical depth profiles and present evidence that cortical depth-dependent modulation of the BOLD signal can be resolved using gradient-echo imaging.},

What is the top-down signal that modulates the response to an attended versus an unattended stimulus? Here, we demonstrate increased activity related to attention in the absence of visual stimulation in extrastriate cortex when subjects covertly directed attention to a peripheral location expecting the onset of visual stimuli. Frontal and parietal areas showed a stronger signal increase during this expectation than did visual areas. The increased activity in visual cortex in the absence of visual stimulation may reflect a top-down bias of neural signals in favor of the attended location, which derives from a fronto-parietal network.},

Here, we examine neuronal activity in the different layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) in an attention-demanding and a working memory task. A current-source density analysis reveales top-down inputs in the superficial layers and layer 5, and an increase in neuronal firing rates most pronounced in the superficial and deep layers and weaker in input layer 4. This increased activity is strongest in the attention task but it is also highly reliable during working memory delays.

  abstract = {Abstract Despite intensive efforts for decades, deformable image registration is still a challenging problem due to the potential large anatomical differences across individual images, which limits the registration performance. Fortunately, this issue could be alleviated if a good initial deformation can be provided for the two images under registration, which are often termed as the moving subject and the fixed template, respectively. In this work, we present a novel patch-based initial deformation prediction framework for improving the performance of existing registration algorithms. Our main idea is to estimate the initial deformation between subject and template in a patch-wise fashion by using the sparse representation technique. We argue that two image patches should follow the same deformation toward the template image if their patch-wise appearance patterns are similar. To this end, our framework consists of two stages, i.e., the training stage and the application stage. In the training stage, we register all training images to the pre-selected template, such that the deformation of each training image with respect to the template is known. In the application stage, we apply the following four steps to efficiently calculate the initial deformation field for the new test subject: (1) We pick a small number of key points in the distinctive regions of the test subject; (2) for each key point, we extract a local patch and form a coupled appearance-deformation dictionary from training images where each dictionary atom consists of the image intensity patch as well as their respective local deformations; (3) a small set of training image patches in the coupled dictionary are selected to represent the image patch of each subject key point by sparse representation. Then, we can predict the initial deformation for each subject key point by propagating the pre-estimated deformations on the selected training patches with the same sparse representation coefficients; and (4) we employ thin-plate splines (TPS) to interpolate a dense initial deformation field by considering all key points as the control points. Thus, the conventional image registration problem becomes much easier in the sense that we only need to compute the remaining small deformation for completing the registration of the subject to the template. Experimental results on both simulated and real data show that the registration performance can be significantly improved after integrating our patch-based deformation prediction framework into the existing registration algorithms. },

  abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different {SPM5} algorithms (?SPM2-type? and regular Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the {DARTEL} Toolbox). All of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study is that the relative performances of the registration methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way {ANOVA} tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's {DARTEL} Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures, with {ART} and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy across subjects and label sets. Updates will be published on the http://www.mindboggle.info/papers/ website. },

  abstract = {Abstract Gyrification of the human cerebral cortex allows for the surface expansion that accommodates many more cortical neurons in comparison to other mammals. For neuroimaging, however, it forms a feature that complicates analysis. For example, it has long been established that cortical layers do not occupy the same depth in gyri and sulci. Recently, in vivo diffusion imaging has provided insights into the fibre architecture of the cortex, usually showing radial tensor orientations. This makes it relevant to investigate whether cortical diffusion tensor metrics depend on the gyral pattern. High-resolution (1 mm isotropic) diffusion weighted \{MRI\} of the medial wall of the hemispheres was performed at 7T. Diffusion data were resampled to surfaces in the cortex and underlying white matter, where the cortical surfaces obeyed the equivolume principle for cortical laminae over the cortical curvature. Diffusion tensor metrics were averaged over bins of curvature to obtain maps of characteristic patterns in the gyrus. Diffusivity, anisotropy and radiality varied with curvature. Radiality was maximal in intermediate layers of the cortex next to the crown of the gyrus, not in white matter or on the crown. In the fundus, the deep cortical layers had tangential tensor orientations. In the white matter, tensor orientation changed from radial on the crown to tangential under the banks and fundus. White matter anisotropy gradually increased from the crown to the fundus. The characteristic pattern in the gyrus demonstrated here is in accordance with ex vivo diffusion \{MR\} microscopy and histological studies. The results indicate the necessity of taking into account the gyral pattern when cortical diffusion data is analysed. Additionally, the data suggest a confound for tractography approaches when reaching the gyrus, resulting in a possible bias towards the gyral crown. The implications for mechanisms that could drive cortical folding are discussed. },

One compelling example of feedback activation of early visual neurons in the absence of bottom-up input occurs during the famous Kanizsa illusion, where a triangular shape is perceived, even in regions of the image where there is no bottom-up visual evidence for it. This illusion increases the firing activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex with a receptive field on the illusory contour [4]. Feedback signals are largely segregated from feedforward signals within each cortical area, with feedforward signals arriving in the middle layer, while top-down feedback avoids the middle layers and predominantly targets deep and superficial layers [1, 2, 5,Â 6]. Therefore, the feedback-mediated activity increase in V1 during the perception of illusory shapes should lead to a specific laminar activity profile that is distinct from the activity elicited by bottom-up stimulation. Here, we used fMRI at high field (7 T) to empirically test this hypothesis, by probing the cortical response to illusory figures in human V1 at different cortical depths [7?14]. We found that, whereas bottom-up stimulation activated all cortical layers, feedback activity induced by illusory figures led to a selective activation of the deep layers ofÂ V1. These results demonstrate the potential for non-invasive recordings of neural activity with laminar specificity in humans and elucidate the role of top-down signals during perceptual processing.

We measure contrast and orientation thresholds for sine-wave gratings, as well uni- and bidirectional offset thresholds for vernier targets.

This paper introduces a model of the micro-structural organization of the cortex, which can compensate for the effect of cortical curvature. Layers are modelled by an equivolumic principle, while the vertical structure of the cortex is represented with a Laplacian model. In this framework, lamination profiles can be represented in a way that preserves the original voxel sampling of the acquisition.

Covert attention increased both the baseline activities and contrast gains in the five cortical areas. The effect on baseline can be decomposed into a transient trial-by-trial component and a component across an entire attention block. On average, increase in contrast gain accounted for approximately 88.0%, 28.5%, 12.7%, 35.9%, and 25.2% of the trial-by-trial effects of attention in the five areas, respectively, and 22.2%, 12.8%, 7.4%, 19.7%, and 17.3% of the total effects of attention in those areas, consistent with single-unit findings in V4 and MT.

  abstract = {Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques enable extraordinarily sensitive and specific in vivo study of the structure, functional response and connectivity of biological mechanisms. With these advanced methods comes a heavy reliance on computer-based processing, analysis and interpretation. While the neuroimaging community has produced many excellent academic and commercial tool packages, new tools are often required to interpret new modalities and paradigms. Developing custom tools and ensuring interoperability with existing tools is a significant hurdle. To address these limitations, we present a new framework for algorithm development that implicitly ensures tool interoperability, generates graphical user interfaces, provides advanced batch processing tools, and, most importantly, requires minimal additional programming or computational overhead. Java-based rapid prototyping with this system is an efficient and practical approach to evaluate new algorithms since the proposed system ensures that rapidly constructed prototypes are actually fully-functional processing modules with support for multiple GUI's, a broad range of file formats, and distributed computation. Herein, we demonstrate MRI image processing with the proposed system for cortical surface extraction in large cross-sectional cohorts, provide a system for fully automated diffusion tensor image analysis, and illustrate how the system can be used as a simulation framework for the development of a new image analysis method. The system is released as open source under the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL) through the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC).},

  abstract  = {The ability to form long-term memories for novel events depends on information processing within the hippocampus (HC) and entorhinal cortex (EC). The HCâ€“EC circuitry shows a quantitative segregation of anatomical directionality into different neuronal layers. Whereas superficial EC layers mainly project to dentate gyrus (DG), CA3 and apical CA1 layers, HC output is primarily sent from pyramidal CA1 layers and subiculum to deep EC layers. Here we utilize this directionality information by measuring encoding activity within HC/EC subregions with 7â€‰T high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Multivariate Bayes decoding within HC/EC subregions shows that processing of novel information most strongly engages the input structures (superficial EC and DG/CA2â€“3), whereas subsequent memory is more dependent on activation of output regions (deep EC and pyramidal CA1). This suggests that while novelty processing is strongly related to HCâ€“EC input pathways, the memory fate of a novel stimulus depends more on HCâ€“EC output.},

  abstract = {A new approach to the problem of multimodality medical image registration is proposed, using a basic concept from information theory, mutual information (MI), or relative entropy, as a new matching criterion. The method presented in this paper applies MI to measure the statistical dependence or information redundancy between the image intensities of corresponding voxels in both images, which is assumed to be maximal if the images are geometrically aligned. Maximization of MI is a very general and powerful criterion, because no assumptions are made regarding the nature of this dependence and no limiting constraints are imposed on the image content of the modalities involved. The accuracy of the MI criterion is validated for rigid body registration of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and photon emission tomography (PET) images by comparison with the stereotactic registration solution, while robustness is evaluated with respect to implementation issues, such as interpolation and optimization, and image content, including partial overlap and image degradation. Our results demonstrate that subvoxel accuracy with respect to the stereotactic reference solution can be achieved completely automatically and without any prior segmentation, feature extraction, or other preprocessing steps which makes this method very well suited for clinical applications.},

  abstract = {Maximization of mutual information of voxel intensities has been demonstrated to be a very powerful criterion for three-dimensional medical image registration, allowing robust and accurate fully automated affine registration of multimodal images in a variety of applications, without the need for segmentation or other preprocessing of the images. In this paper, we investigate the performance of various optimization methods and multiresolution strategies for maximization of mutual information, aiming at increasing registration speed when matching large high-resolution images. We show that mutual information is a continuous function of the affine registration parameters when appropriate interpolation is used and we derive analytic expressions of its derivatives that allow numerically exact evaluation of its gradient. Various multiresolution gradient- and non-gradient-based optimization strategies, such as Powell, simplex, steepest-descent, conjugate-gradient, quasi-Newton and Levenberg?Marquardt methods, are evaluated for registration of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance images of the brain. Speed-ups of a factor of 3 on average compared to Powell's method at full resolution are achieved with similar precision and without a loss of robustness with the simplex, conjugate-gradient and Levenberg?Marquardt method using a two-level multiresolution scheme. Large data sets such as 2562 × 128 \{MR\} and 5122 × 48 \{CT\} images can be registered with subvoxel precision in &lt; 5 min \{CPU\} time on current workstations. },

  abstract = {Spatial patterns of spontaneous neural activity at rest have previously been associated with specific networks in the brain, including those pertaining to the functional architecture of the primary visual cortex (V1). However, despite the prominent anatomical differences between cortical layers, little is known about the laminar pattern of spontaneous activity in V1. We address this topic by investigating the amplitude and coherence of ongoing local field potential (LFP) signals measured from different layers in V1 of macaque monkeys during rest and upon presentation of a visual stimulus. We used a linear microelectrode array to measure LFP signals at multiple, evenly spaced positions throughout the cortical thickness. Analyzing both the mean LFP amplitudes and between-contact LFP coherences, we identified two distinct zones of activity, roughly corresponding to superficial and deep layers, divided by a sharp transition near the bottom of layer 4. The LFP signals within each laminar zone were highly coherent, whereas those between zones were not. This functional compartmentalization was found not only during rest, but also when the receptive field was stimulated during a visual task. These results demonstrate the existence of distinct superficial and deep functional domains of coherent LFP activity in V1 that may reflect the intrinsic interplay of V1 microcircuitry with cortical and subcortical targets, respectively.},

However, intracortical veins perpendicular to the cortical surface are suspected to degrade the laminar specificity as they drain blood from the microvasculature and \{BOLD\} signal is carried over from lower to upper cortical layers on its way to the pial surface. In this work, a vascular model of the cortex is developed to investigate the laminar specificity of the \{BOLD\} signal for Spin Echo (SE) and Gradient Echo (GE) following the integrative model presented by Uluda? et al. (2009). The results of the simulation show that the laminar point spread function (PSF) of the \{BOLD\} signal presents similar features across all layers. The \{PSF\} for \{SE\} is highly localised whereas for \{GE\} there is a flat tail running to the pial surface, with amplitude less than a quarter of the response from the layer itself. Consequently the \{GE\} response at any layer will also contain a contribution accumulated from all lower layers. },

  abstract = {The large spatial inhomogeneity in transmit B(1) field (B(1)(+)) observable in human MR images at high static magnetic fields (B(0)) severely impairs image quality. To overcome this effect in brain T(1)-weighted images, the MPRAGE sequence was modified to generate two different images at different inversion times, MP2RAGE. By combining the two images in a novel fashion, it was possible to create T(1)-weighted images where the result image was free of proton density contrast, T(2) contrast, reception bias field, and, to first order, transmit field inhomogeneity. MP2RAGE sequence parameters were optimized using Bloch equations to maximize contrast-to-noise ratio per unit of time between brain tissues and minimize the effect of B(1)(+) variations through space. Images of high anatomical quality and excellent brain tissue differentiation suitable for applications such as segmentation and voxel-based morphometry were obtained at 3 and 7 T. From such T(1)-weighted images, acquired within 12 min, high-resolution 3D T(1) maps were routinely calculated at 7 T with sub-millimeter voxel resolution (0.65-0.85 mm isotropic). T(1) maps were validated in phantom experiments. In humans, the T(1) values obtained at 7 T were 1.15+/-0.06 s for white matter (WM) and 1.92+/-0.16 s for grey matter (GM), in good agreement with literature values obtained at lower spatial resolution. At 3 T, where whole-brain acquisitions with 1 mm isotropic voxels were acquired in 8 min, the T(1) values obtained (0.81+/-0.03 s for WM and 1.35+/-0.05 for GM) were once again found to be in very good agreement with values in the literature.},

The modulation by spatial attention changes the gain of sensory neurons and strengthens the representation of attended locations without changing neuronal selectivities such as directionality, i.e., the ratio of responses to preferred and anti-preferred directions of motion. Whether feature-based attention acts in a similar manner is unknown. Results: To clarify this issue, we recorded the responses of 135 direction-selective neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of two macaques to an unattended moving random dot pattern (the distractor) positioned inside a neuron's receptive field while the animals attended to a second moving pattern positioned in the opposite hemifield. Responses to different directions of the distractor were modulated by the same factor (approximately 12%) as long as the attended direction remained unchanged. On the other hand, systematically changing the attended direction from a neuron's preferred to its anti-preferred direction caused a systematic change of the attentional modulation from an enhancement to a suppression, increasing directionality by about 20%. Conclusions: The results show that (1) feature-based attention exerts a multiplicative modulation upon neuronal responses and that the strength of this modulation depends on the similarity between the attended feature and the cell's preferred feature, in line with the feature-similarity gain model, and (2) at the level of the neuronal population, feature-based attention increases the selectivity for attended features by increasing the responses of neurons preferring this feature value while decreasing responses of neurons tuned to the opposite feature value.},

  abstract  = {The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate one{\textquoteright}s code, harming the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one{\textquoteright}s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code, in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one{\textquoteright}s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging tools. With Porcupine, we intend to bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of the analysis and thus create better reproducible and shareable science. We give the researcher a better oversight of their pipeline, both while developing and communicating their work. This may also be a useful tool in the education of novice neuroimaging students, considerably cutting their learning phase. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine.},

Here we discuss the nature and causes of collinearity in fMRI models, with a focus on the appropriate uses of orthogonalization. Special attention is given to how the two popular fMRI data analysis software packages, SPM and FSL, handle orthogonalization, and pitfalls that may be encountered in their usage.

  abstract = {Although visual spatial attention has been shown to increase activity as measured with both fMRI and electrophysiological techniques, significant differences in the results have been shown. fMRI studies have routinely demonstrated large signal increases to an attended versus unattended stimulus in early visual areas (V1-V3) whereas some previous electrophysiology research has either shown very small or no differences in spike rate. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that most previous fMRI studies have not differentiated between stimulus-evoked and baseline-shift changes in the response to an attended stimulus. Here, fMRI was used to separately measure stimulus-evoked and baseline-shift responses. In the first experiment, contrast-response functions to grating stimuli that were either attended or unattended were measured. The results show that the increases in fMRI signal associated with spatial attention are accounted for by a baseline shift. In a second experiment, spatial attention was fixed in a single location that isolated possible stimulus-evoked changes with attention. Consistent with the first experiment, no stimulus-evoked changes were found. These results potentially reconcile previous discrepant findings between fMRI studies and some neurophysiology studies of attention by demonstrating that the effects of spatial attention in early visual areas can be dominated by stimulus-independent shifts in baseline responses.},

  abstract = {Summary Attention is critical to perception, serving to select behaviorally relevant information for privileged processing. To understand the neural mechanisms of attention, we must discern how attentional modulation varies by cell type and across cortical layers. Here, we test whether attention acts non-selectively across cortical layers or whether it engages the laminar circuit in specific and selective ways. We find layer- and cell-class-specific differences in several different forms of attentional modulation in area V4. Broad-spiking neurons in the superficial layers exhibit attention-mediated increases in firing rate and decreases in variability. Spike count correlations are highest in the input layer and attention serves to reduce these correlations. Superficial and input layer neurons exhibit attention-dependent decreases in low-frequency (&lt;10 Hz) coherence, but deep layer neurons exhibit increases in coherence in the beta and gamma frequency ranges. Our study provides a template for attention-mediated laminar information processing that might be applicable across sensory modalities. },

This paper describes the OpenFMRI project (accessible online at http://www.openfmri.org), which aims to provide the neuroimaging community with a resource to support open sharing of task-based fMRI studies. We describe the motivation behind the project, focusing particularly on how this project addresses some of the well-known challenges to sharing of task-based fMRI data. Results from a preliminary analysis of the current database are presented, which demonstrate the ability to classify between task contrasts with high generalization accuracy across subjects, and the ability to identify individual subjects from their activation maps with moderately high accuracy. Clustering analyses show that the similarity relations between statistical maps have a somewhat orderly relation to the mental functions engaged by the relevant tasks. These results highlight the potential of the project to support large-scale multivariate analyses of the relation between mental processes and brain function.},

  abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) most commonly employs 2D echo-planar imaging (EPI). The advantages for fMRI brought about by the increasingly popular ultra-high field strengths are best exploited in high-resolution acquisitions, but here 2D EPI becomes impractical for several reasons, including the very long volume acquisitions times. In this study at 7 T, a 3D EPI sequence with full parallel and partial Fourier imaging capability along both phase encoding axes was implemented and used to evaluate the sensitivity of 3D and corresponding 2D EPI acquisitions at four different spatial resolutions ranging from small to typical voxel sizes (1.5-3.0 mm isotropic). Whole-brain resting state measurements (N=4) revealed a better, or at least comparable sensitivity of the 3D method for gray and white matter. The larger vulnerability of 3D to physiological effects was outweighed by the much shorter volume TR, which moreover allows whole-brain coverage at high resolution within fully acceptable limits for event-related fMRI: TR was only 3.07 s for 1.5 mm, 1.88 s for 2.0 mm, 1.38 s for 2.5 mm and 1.07 s for 3.0 mm isotropic resolution. In order to investigate the ability to detect and spatially resolve BOLD activation in the visual cortex, functional 3D EPI experiments (N=8) were performed at 1 mm isotropic resolution with parallel imaging acceleration of 3x3, resulting in a TR of only 3.2 s for whole-brain coverage. From our results, and several other practical advantages of 3D over 2D EPI found in the present study, we conclude that 3D EPI provides a useful alternative for whole-brain fMRI at 7 T, not only when high-resolution data are required.},

This paper explores one aspect of cognition through the use of a simple model task in which human subjects are asked to commit attention to a position in visual space other than fixation. This instruction is executed by orienting a covert (attentional) mechanism that seems sufficiently time locked to external events that its trajectory can be traced across the visual field in terms of momentary changes in the efficiency of detecting stimuli. A comparison of results obtained with alert monkeys, brain injured and normal human subjects shows the relationship of this covert system to saccadic eye movements and to various brain systems controlling perception and motion. In accordance with Bartlett's insight, the possibility is explored that similar principles apply to orienting of attention toward sensory input and orienting to the semantic structures used in thinking. },

  abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were obtained in human visual cortex using sub-millimeter voxels at a field strength of 3 T. Reliable functional signals were largely confined to the gray matter and these responses measure the retinotopic organization of visual cortex. Functional signals were further characterized with respect to their laminar position within the cortical gray matter. The laminar response profiles during our visuospatial attention task, normalized for cortical thickness, had a stereotypical shape, with a peak in the superficial gray matter and declining in the deeper layers. The thickness of the sheet producing functional signals was in excellent agreement with the estimated structural thickness of the gray matter throughout early visual cortex (error &lt; 0.5 mm). Thickness measurements were highly repeatable from session-to-session (error &lt; 0.4 mm). Hence, it is feasible and useful to use high-resolution fMRI to measure laminar activity profiles. The ability to distinguish signals arising in different lamina has significant potential scientific and clinical applications. },

  abstract = {The analysis of raw data in neuroimaging has become a computationally entrenched process with many intricate steps run on increasingly larger datasets. Many software packages exist that provide either complete analyses or specific steps in an analysis. These packages often possess diverse input and output requirements, utilize different file formats, run in particular environments, and have limited abilities with certain types of data. The combination of these packages to achieve more sensitive and accurate results has become a common tactic in brain mapping studies but requires much work to ensure valid interoperation between programs. The handling, organization, and storage of intermediate data can prove difficult as well. The LONI Pipeline Processing Environment is a simple, efficient, and distributed computing solution to these problems enabling software inclusion from different laboratories in different environments. It is used here to derive a T1-weighted MRI atlas of the human brain from 452 normal young adult subjects with fully automated processing. The LONI Pipeline Processing Environment’s parallel processing efficiency using an integrated client/server dataflow model was 80.9% when running the atlas generation pipeline from a PC client (Acer TravelMate 340T) on 48 dedicated server processors (Silicon Graphics Inc. Origin 3000). The environment was 97.5% efficient when the same analysis was run on eight dedicated processors.},

Such registration is generally implemented by minimizing a cost functional, which measures the mismatch between two image volumes over the group of proper affine transformations. Widely used cost functionals, such as mutual information (MI) and correlation ratio (CR), appear to yield decent alignments when visually judged by matching outer brain contours. However, close inspection reveals that internal brain structures are often significantly misaligned. Poor registration is most evident in the ventricles and sulcal folds, where \{CSF\} is concentrated. This observation motivated our development of an improved modality-specific cost functional which uses a weighted local Pearson coefficient (LPC) to align T2?- and T1-weighted images. In the absence of an alignment gold standard, we used three human observers blinded to registration method to provide an independent assessment of the quality of the registration for each cost functional. We found that \{LPC\} performed significantly better (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001) than generic cost functionals including \{MI\} and CR. Generic cost functionals were very often not minimal near the best alignment, thereby suggesting that optimization is not the cause of their failure. Lastly, we emphasize the importance of precise visual inspection of alignment quality and present an automated method for generating composite images that help capture errors of misalignment. },

  abstract = {SummaryBackground What roles do the different cortical layers play in visual processing? We recorded simultaneously from all layers of the primary visual cortex while monkeys performed a figure-ground segregation task. This task can be divided into different subprocesses that are thought to engage feedforward, horizontal, and feedback processes at different time points. These different connection types have different patterns of laminar terminations in \{V1\} and can therefore be distinguished with laminar recordings. Results We found that the visual response started 40 ms after stimulus presentation in layers 4 and 6, which are targets of feedforward connections from the lateral geniculate nucleus and distribute activity to the other layers. Boundary detection started shortly after the visual response. In this phase, boundaries of the figure induced synaptic currents and stronger neuronal responses in upper layer 4 and the superficial layers ?70 ms after stimulus onset, consistent with the hypothesis that they are detected by horizontal connections. In the next phase, ?30 ms later, synaptic inputs arrived in layers 1, 2, and 5 that receive feedback from higher visual areas, which caused the filling in of the representation of the entire figure with enhanced neuronal activity. Conclusions The present results reveal unique contributions of the different cortical layers to the formation of a visual percept. This new blueprint of laminar processing may generalize to other tasks and to other areas of the cerebral cortex, where the layers are likely to have roles similar to those in area V1. },

What can we expect this exciting new technique to discover about cortical processing and how can we verify that it is producing an accurate picture of the underlying laminar differences in neural processing? This review will address our knowledge of laminar cortical circuitry gained from electrophysiological studies in macaque monkeys with a focus on the primary visual cortex, as this area has been most often targeted in both laminar electrophysiological and fMRI studies. We will review how recent studies are attempting to verify the accuracy of laminar fMRI by recreating the known laminar profiles of various neural tuning properties. Furthermore, we will examine how feedforward and feedback-related neural processes engage different cortical layers, producing canonical patterns of spiking and synaptic activity as estimated by the analysis of current-source density. These results provide a benchmark for recent studies aiming to examine the profiles of bottom-up and top-down processes with laminar fMRI. Finally, we will highlight particularly useful paradigms and approaches which may help us to understand processing in the different layers of the human cerebral cortex.},

  abstract  = {<p>High-field gradient-echo (GE) BOLD fMRI enables very high resolution imaging, and has great potential for detailed investigations of brain function. However, as spatial resolution increases, confounds due to signal from non-capillary vessels increasingly impact the fidelity of GE BOLD fMRI signals. Here we report on an assessment of the microvascular weighting of the GE BOLD response across the cortical depth in human cortex using spin-echo fMRI which is thought to be dominated by microvasculature (albeit not completely). BOLD responses were measured with a hemodynamic impulse response (HRF) obtained from the spin-echo (SE) and gradient-echo (GE) BOLD contrast using very short stimuli (0.25 s) and a fast event-related functional paradigm. We show that the onset (?1.25 s) and the rising slope of the GE and SE HRFs are strikingly similar for voxels in deep gray matter presumably containing the most metabolically demanding neurons (layers III?IV). This finding provides a strong indication that the onset of the GE HRF in deep gray matter is predominantly associated with microvasculature.</p>},

  abstract = {Selective visual attention can strongly influence perceptual processing, even for apparently low-level visual stimuli. Although it is largely accepted that attention modulates neural activity in extrastriate visual cortex, the extent to which attention operates in the first cortical stage, striate visual cortex (area V1), remains controversial. Here, functional MRI was used at high field strength (3 T) to study humans during attentionally demanding visual discriminations. Similar, robust attentional modulations were observed in both striate and extrastriate cortical areas. Functional mapping of cortical retinotopy demonstrates that attentional modulations were spatially specific, enhancing responses to attended stimuli and suppressing responses when attention was directed elsewhere. The spatial pattern of modulation reveals a complex attentional window that is consistent with object-based attention but is inconsistent with a simple attentional spotlight. These data suggest that neural processing in V1 is not governed simply by sensory stimulation, but, like extrastriate regions, V1 can be strongly and specifically influenced by attention.},

One of the main limits on the accuracy of this alignment arises from differences in the geometric distortion induced by magnetic field inhomogeneity. This paper describes an approach to the registration of echo planar image (EPI) data to conventional anatomical images which takes into account this difference in geometric distortion. The authors make use of an additional spin echo EPI image and use the known signal conservation in spin echo distortion to derive a specialized multimodality nonrigid registration algorithm. They also examine a plausible modification using log-intensity evaluation of the criterion to provide increased sensitivity in areas of low EPI signal. A phantom-based imaging experiment is used to evaluate the behavior of the different criteria, comparing nonrigid displacement estimates to those provided by a magnetic field mapping acquisition. The algorithm is then applied to a range of nine brain imaging studies illustrating global and local improvement in the anatomical alignment and localization of fMRI activations.},

  abstract = {Abstract The position of cortical areas can be approximately predicted from cortical surface folding patterns. However, there is extensive inter-subject variability in cortical folding patterns, prohibiting a one-to-one mapping of cortical folds in certain areas. In addition, the relationship between cortical area boundaries and the shape of the cortex is variable, and weaker for higher-order cortical areas. Current surface registration techniques align cortical folding patterns using sulcal landmarks or cortical curvature, for instance. The alignment of cortical areas by these techniques is thus inherently limited by the sole use of geometric similarity metrics. Magnetic resonance imaging \{T1\} maps show intra-cortical contrast that reflects myelin content, and thus can be used to improve the alignment of cortical areas. In this article, we present a new symmetric diffeomorphic multi-contrast multi-scale surface registration (MMSR) technique that works with partially inflated surfaces in the level-set framework. \{MMSR\} generates a more precise alignment of cortical surface curvature in comparison to two widely recognized surface registration algorithms. The resulting overlap in gyrus labels is comparable to FreeSurfer. Most importantly, \{MMSR\} improves the alignment of cortical areas further by including \{T1\} maps. As a first application, we present a group average \{T1\} map at a uniquely high-resolution and multiple cortical depths, which reflects the myeloarchitecture of the cortex. \{MMSR\} can also be applied to other \{MR\} contrasts, such as functional and connectivity data. },

  abstract = {Abstract The human neocortex is organized radially into six layers which differ in their myelination and the density and arrangement of neuronal cells. This cortical cyto- and myeloarchitecture plays a central role in the anatomical and functional neuroanatomy but is primarily accessible through invasive histology only. To overcome this limitation, several non-invasive MRI approaches have been, and are being, developed to resolve the anatomical cortical layers. As a result, recent studies on large populations and structure-function relationships at the laminar level became possible. Early proof-of-concept studies targeted conspicuous laminar structures such as the stria of Gennari in the primary visual cortex. Recent work characterized the laminar structure outside the visual cortex, investigated the relationship between laminar structure and function, and demonstrated layer-specific maturation effects. This paper reviews the methods and in-vivo MRI studies on the anatomical layers in the human cortex based on conventional and quantitative MRI (excluding diffusion imaging). A focus is on the related challenges, promises and potential future developments. The rapid development of MRI scanners, motion correction techniques, analysis methods and biophysical modeling promise to overcome the challenges of spatial resolution, precision and specificity of systematic imaging of cortical laminae.},

  abstract = {The Center for Magnetic Resonance (CMRR) at the University of Minnesota was one of the laboratories where the work that simultaneously and independently introduced functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of human brain activity was carried out. However, unlike other laboratories pursuing fMRI at the time, our work was performed at 4 T magnetic field and coincided with the effort to push human magnetic resonance imaging to field strength significantly beyond 1.5 T which was the high-end standard of the time. The human fMRI experiments performed in {CMRR} were planned between two colleagues who had known each other and had worked together previously in Bell Laboratories, namely Seiji Ogawa and myself, immediately after the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast was developed by Seiji. We were waiting for our first human system, a 4 T system, to arrive in order to attempt at imaging brain activity in the human brain and these were the first experiments we performed on the 4 T instrument in {CMRR} when it became marginally operational. This was a prelude to a subsequent systematic push we initiated for exploiting higher magnetic fields to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of fMRI maps, first going to 9.4 T for animal model studies and subsequently developing a 7 T human system for the first time. Steady improvements in high field instrumentation and ever expanding armamentarium of image acquisition and engineering solutions to challenges posed by ultrahigh fields have brought fMRI to submillimeter resolution in the whole brain at 7 T, the scale necessary to reach cortical columns and laminar differentiation in the whole brain. The solutions that emerged in response to technological challenges posed by 7 T also propagated and continues to propagate to lower field clinical systems, a major advantage of the ultrahigh fields effort that is underappreciated. Further improvements at 7 T are inevitable. Further translation of these improvements to lower field clinical systems to achieve new capabilities and to magnetic fields significantly higher than 7 T to enable human imaging is inescapable. },

Developing an understanding of the physiological role of these circuits requires dissection of the functional specificity and connectivity of the underlying individual projection neurons. By combining whole-cell recording from identified \{L6\} principal cells in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) with modified rabies virus-based input mapping, we have determined the sensory response properties and upstream monosynaptic connectivity of cells mediating the \{CC\} or \{CT\} pathway. We show that CC-projecting cells encompass a broad spectrum of selectivity to stimulus orientation and are predominantly innervated by deep layer \{V1\} neurons. In contrast, CT-projecting cells are ultrasparse firing, exquisitely tuned to orientation and direction information, and receive long-range input from higher cortical areas. This segregation in function and connectivity indicates that \{L6\} microcircuits route specific contextual and stimulus-related information within and outside the cortical network. },

  abstract = {Abstract Structural magnetic resonance imaging can now resolve laminar features within the cerebral cortex in vivo. A variety of intracortical contrasts have been used to study the cortical myeloarchitecture with the purpose of mapping cortical areas in individual subjects. In this article, we first briefly review recent advances in \{MRI\} analysis of cortical microstructure to portray the potential and limitations of the current state-of-the-art. We then present an integrated framework for the analysis of intracortical structure, composed of novel image processing tools designed for high resolution cortical images. The main features of our framework are the segmentation of quantitative \{T1\} maps to delineate the cortical boundaries (Bazin et al., 2014), and the use of an equivolume layering model to define an intracortical coordinate system that follows the anatomical layers of the cortex (Waehnert et al., 2014). We evaluate the framework with 150 ?m isotropic post mortem T2?-weighted images and 0.5 mm isotropic in vivo \{T1\} maps, a quantitative index of myelin content. We study the laminar structure of the primary visual cortex (Brodmann area 17) in the post mortem and in vivo data, as well as the central sulcus region in vivo, in particular Brodmann areas 1, 3b and 4. We also investigate the impact of the layering models on the relationship between \{T1\} and cortical curvature. Our experiments demonstrate that the equivolume intracortical surfaces and transcortical profiles best reflect the laminar structure of the cortex in areas of curvature in comparison to the state-of-the-art equidistant and Laplace implementations. This framework generates a subject specific intracortical coordinate system, the basis for subsequent architectonic analyses of the cortex. Any structural or functional contrast co-registered to the \{T1\} maps, used to segment the cortex, can be sampled on the curved grid for analysis. This work represents an important step towards in vivo structural brain mapping of individual subjects. },

We measured neural population activity [multiunit spike activity (MUA) and local field potential, LFP] in Macaque primary visual cortex (V1) in response to drifting grating stimuli. Sustained visually driven MUA was at an approximately constant level across cortical depth in V1. However, sustained, visually driven, local field potential power, which was concentrated in the Î³-band (20-60 Hz), was greatest at the cortical depth corresponding to cortico-cortical output layers 2, 3, and 4B. Î³-band power also tends to be more sustained in the output layers. Overall, cortico-cortical output layers accounted for 67% of total Î³-band activity in V1, whereas 56% of total spikes evoked by drifting gratings were from layers 2, 3, and 4B. The high-resolution layer specificity of Î³-band power, the laminar distribution of MUA and Î³-band activity, and their dynamics imply that neural activity in V1 is generated by laminar-specific mechanisms. In particular, visual responses of MUA and Î³-band activity in cortico-cortical output layers 2, 3, and 4B seem to be strongly influenced by laminar-specific recurrent circuitry and/or feedback.},

  abstract  = {At high magnetic fields (7 and 8.4 T), water proton magnetic resonance images of brains of live mice and rats under pentobarbital anesthetization have been measured by a gradient echo pulse sequence with a spatial resolution of 65 × 65-μm pixel size and 700-μm slice thickness. The contrast in these images depicts anatomical details of the brain by numerous dark lines of various sizes. These lines are absent in the image taken by the usual spin echo sequence. They represent the blood vessels in the image slice and appear when the deoxyhemoglobin content in the red cells increases. This contrast is most pronounced in an anoxy brain but not present in a brain with diamagnetic oxy or carbon monoxide hemoglobin. The local field induced by the magnetic susceptibility change in the blood due to the paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin causes the intra voxel dephasing of the water signals of the blood and the surrounding tissue. This oxygena-tion-dependent contrast is appreciable in high field images with high spatial resolution. © 1990 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract  = {MRI has advanced to being one of the major tools for the assessment of brain function. This review article examines the basic principles that underpin these measurements. The main emphasis is on the characteristics and detection of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast. In the first part of the article the relationship between BOLD, blood flow, blood oxygen, and the rate of metabolic consumption of oxygen is described. The four contrast mechanisms that contribute to the BOLD signal change, namely extravascular static and dynamic dephasing, intravascular T2-like changes, and the intravascular frequency offset effect are described in terms of their spatial localization and relative contributions to the BOLD signal. The current model of changes in blood flow being an indirect consequence of synaptic input to a region is presented. The second section of the article deals with the imaging characteristics of BOLD in terms of the attainable spatial resolution and linear system characteristics. In the third section, practical BOLD imaging is examined for choice of pulse sequence, resolution, echo time (TE), repetition time (TR), and flip angle. The final section touches on other MRI approaches that are relevant to cognitive neuroimaging, in particular the measurement of blood flow, blood volume, resting state fluctuations in the BOLD signal, and measures of connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging and fiber-tracking.

  abstract  = {MRI was extended to the measurement of changes in oxidative metabolism in the normal human during functionally induced changes in cellular activity. A noninvasive MRI method that is model-independent calibrates the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal of functional MRI (fMRI) against perfusion-sensitive MRI, using carbon dioxide breathing as a physiological reference standard. This calibration procedure provides a regional measurement of the expected sensitivity of the fMRI BOLD signal to changes in the cellular activity of the brain. Maps of the BOLD signal calibration factor showed regional heterogeneity, indicating that the magnitude of functionally induced changes in the BOLD signal will be dependent on both the local change in blood flow and the local baseline physiology of the cerebral cortex. BOLD signal magnitude is shown to be reduced by 32% from its expected level by the action of oxygen metabolism. The calibrated fMRI technique was applied to stimulation of the human visual cortex with an alternating radial checkerboard pattern. With this stimulus oxygen consumption increased 16% whereas blood flow increased 45%. Although this result is consistent with previous findings of a significant difference between the increase in blood flow and oxygen consumption, it does indicate clearly that oxidative metabolism is a significant component of the metabolic response of the brain to functionally induced changes in cellular activity.},

  abstract = {Abstract Quantitative cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI has the potential to overcome several specific limitations of BOLD fMRI. It provides direct physiological interpretability and promises superior localization specificity in applications of sub-millimeter resolution fMRI applications at ultra-high magnetic fields (7T and higher). Non-invasive CBV fMRI using VASO (vascular space occupancy), however, is inherently limited with respect to its data acquisition efficiency, restricting its imaging coverage and achievable spatial and temporal resolution. This limitation may be reduced with recent advanced acceleration and reconstruction strategies that allow two-dimensional acceleration, such as in simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) 2D-EPI or 3D-EPI in combination with CAIPIRINHA field-of-view shifting. In this study, we sought to determine the functional sensitivity and specificity of these readout strategies with VASO over a broad range of spatial resolutions; spanning from low spatial resolution (3mm) whole-cortex to sub-millimeter (0.75mm) slab-of-cortex (for cortical layer-dependent applications). In the thermal-noise-dominated regime of sub-millimeter resolutions, 3D-EPI-VASO provides higher temporal stability and sensitivity to detect changes in CBV compared to 2D-EPI-VASO. In this regime, 3D-EPI-VASO unveils task activation located in the cortical laminae with little contamination from surface veins, in contrast to the cortical surface weighting of GE-BOLD fMRI. In the physiological-noise-dominated regime of lower resolutions, however, 2D-SMS-VASO shows superior performance compared to 3D-EPI-VASO. Due to its superior sensitivity at a layer-dependent level, 3D-EPI VASO promises to play an important role in future neuroscientific applications of layer-dependent fMRI.},

This review provides a practical guide and overview of the clinical applications of ASL of the brain, as well its potential pitfalls. The technical and physiological background is also addressed. At present, main areas of interest are cerebrovascular disease, dementia and neuro-oncology. In cerebrovascular disease, ASL is of particular interest owing to its quantitative nature and its capability to determine cerebral arterial territories. In acute stroke, the source of the collateral blood supply in the penumbra may be visualised. In chronic cerebrovascular disease, the extent and severity of compromised cerebral perfusion can be visualised, which may be used to guide therapeutic or preventative intervention. ASL has potential for the detection and follow-up of arteriovenous malformations. In the workup of dementia patients, ASL is proposed as a diagnostic alternative to PET. It can easily be added to the routinely performed structural MRI examination. In patients with established Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, hypoperfusion patterns are seen that are similar to hypometabolism patterns seen with PET. Studies on ASL in brain tumour imaging indicate a high correlation between areas of increased CBF as measured with ASL and increased cerebral blood volume as measured with dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging. Major advantages of ASL for brain tumour imaging are the fact that CBF measurements are not influenced by breakdown of the blood--brain barrier, as well as its quantitative nature, facilitating multicentre and longitudinal studies.},

As a result of this complex dependence, the accurate interpretation of BOLD data and robust intersubject comparisons when the baseline physiology is varied are difficult.

  abstract = {Abstract Cerebral blood volume (CBV)-weighted endogenous functional contrast can be obtained by the vascular space occupancy (VASO) technique. VASO relies on nonselective inversion for nulling blood signals, but the implementation of VASO at magnetic fields higher than 3 T is difficult due to converging T1 values of tissue and blood water and a stronger counteracting blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) effect. To improve functional CBV sensitivity, we proposed to use VASO with slab-selective inversion (SI-VASO). Computer simulations showed that the SI-VASO approach significantly increases functional sensitivity compared to the original VASO in a stronger magnetic field with a shorter repetition time. To examine layer-dependent specificity, SI-VASO and spin-echo BOLD (SE-BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments were performed on isoflurane-anesthetized cats during visual stimulation at 9.4 T. Unlike simultaneously acquired SE-BOLD signal, the SI-VASO signal peaked at 0.9 mm from the surface of the cortex and was localized to the middle cortical layer. The full-width at half maximal response across the cortex was narrower for SI-VASO than for SE-BOLD (1.7 mm vs. 2.5 mm, respectively), suggesting that SI-VASO is better localized to neuronally active sites than SE-BOLD fMRI. The magnitude of the SI-VASO change in the middle cortex was −1.45% with our experimental parameters, corresponding to a relative CBV change of ∼8% when baseline CBV was assumed to be 5% in a two-compartment model. The signal response profile across the cortex, the calculated CBV change, and the time course of SI-VASO fMRI were similar to those of previously obtained CBV-weighted fMRI with contrast agent in the same animal model, suggesting that SI-VASO measures predominately functional CBV responses.},

It is not known if and how layer-specific neural processes are reflected in the fMRI signal. To address this question we used high-resolution fMRI to measure BOLD, CBV, and CBF responses to stimuli that elicit positive and negative BOLD signals in macaque primary visual cortex. We found that regions with positive BOLD responses had parallel increases in CBV and CBF, whereas areas with negative BOLD responses showed a decrease in CBF but an increase in CBV. For positive BOLD responses, CBF and CBV increased in the center of the cortex, but for negative BOLD responses, CBF decreased superficially while CBV increased in the center. Our findings suggest different mechanisms for neurovascular coupling for BOLD increases and decreases, as well as laminar differences in neurovascular coupling.},

  abstract  = {During brain activation, local control of oxygen delivery is facilitated through microvascular dilatation and constriction. A new functional MRI (fMRI) methodology is reported that is sensitive to these microvascular adjustments. This contrast is accomplished by eliminating the blood signal in a manner that is independent of blood oxygenation and flow. As a consequence, changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) can be assessed through changes in the remaining extravascular water signal (i.e., that of parenchymal tissue) without need for exogenous contrast agents or any other invasive procedures. The feasibility of this vascular space occupancy (VASO)-dependent functional MRI (fMRI) approach is demonstrated for visual stimulation, breath-hold (hypercapnia), and hyperventilation (hypocapnia). During visual stimulation and breath-hold, the VASO signal shows an inverse correlation with the stimulus paradigm, consistent with local vasodilatation. This effect is reversed during hyperventilation. Comparison of the hemodynamic responses of VASO-fMRI, cerebral blood flow (CBF)-based fMRI, and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI indicates both arteriolar and venular temporal characteristics in VASO. The effect of changes in water exchange rate and partial volume contamination with CSF were calculated to be negligible. At the commonly-used fMRI resolution of 3.75 × 3.75 × 5 mm3, the contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR) of VASO-fMRI was comparable to that of CBF-based fMRI, but a factor of 3 lower than for BOLD-fMRI. Arguments supporting a better gray matter localization for the VASO-fMRI approach compared to BOLD are provided. Magn Reson Med 50:263–274, 2003. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

To investigate this issue, high-resolution fMRI in response to visual stimulus was obtained in isoflurane-anesthetized cats at 9.4 T using conventional gradient-echo (GE) and spin-echo (SE) techniques; blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood volume (CBV)-weighted data were acquired without and with injection of 10 mg Fe/kg monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles (MION), respectively. Studies after MION injection at two SE times show that the T2′ contribution to SE fMRI is minimal. GE and SE BOLD changes were spread across the cortical layers. GE and SE CBV-weighted fMRI responses peaked at the middle cortical layer, which has the highest experimentally-determined microvascular volume; full-width at half-maximum was <1.0 mm. Parenchymal sensitivity of GE CBV-weighted fMRI was ∼3 times higher than that of SE CBV-weighted fMRI and ∼1.5 times higher than that of BOLD fMRI. It is well known that GE CBV-weighted fMRI detects a volume change in vessels of all sizes, while SE CBV-weighted fMRI is heavily weighted toward microvascular changes. Peak CBV change of 10% at the middle of the cortex in GE measurements was 1.8 times higher than that in SE measurements, indicating that CBV changes occur predominantly for vasculature connecting the intracortical vessels and capillaries. Our data supports the notion of laminar-dependent CBV regulation at a sub-millimeter scale.},

We found an unexpected striking difference in gamma synchrony in the superficial vs. deep layers. In all three areas, spike-field coherence in the gamma (40–60 Hz) frequency range was largely confined to the superficial layers, whereas the deep layers showed maximal coherence at low frequencies (6–16 Hz), which included the alpha range. In the superficial layers of V2 and V4, gamma synchrony was enhanced by attention, whereas in the deep layers, alpha synchrony was reduced by attention. Unlike these major differences in synchrony, attentional effects on firing rates and noise correlation did not differ substantially between the superficial and deep layers. The results suggest that synchrony plays very different roles in feedback and feedforward projections.},

  abstract = {A local field potential (LFP) response can be measured throughout the visual cortex in response to the abrupt appearance of a visual stimulus. Averaging LFP responses to many stimulus presentations isolates transient, phase-locked components of the response that are consistent from trial to trial. However, stimulus responses are also composed of sustained components, which differ in their phase from trial to trial and therefore must be evaluated using other methods, such as computing the power of the response of each trial before averaging. Here, we investigate the basis of phase-locked and non-phase-locked LFP responses in the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey using a novel variant of current source density (CSD) analysis. We applied a linear array of electrode contacts spanning the thickness of the cortex to measure the LFP and compute band-limited CSD power to identify the laminar sites of persistent current exchange that may be the basis of sustained visual LFP responses. In agreement with previous studies, we found a short-latency phase-locked current sink, thought to correspond to thalamocortical input to layer 4C. In addition, we found a prominent non-phase-locked component of the CSD that persisted as long as the stimulus was physically present. The latter was relatively broadband, lasted throughout the stimulus presentation, and was centered ∼500 μm deeper than the initial current sink. These findings demonstrate a fundamental difference in the neural mechanisms underlying the initial and sustained processing of simple visual stimuli in the V1 microcircuit.},

  abstract  = {The spatial relationship between a measured fMRI signal and its underlying neuronal activity remains unclear. One obstacle is the localization of neuronal activity; another is the spatial resolution of fMRI. In the present study, high-resolution BOLD and CBV fMRI experiments (voxel size: 156 × 156 × 2000 μm3) were conducted in the rat whisker barrel cortex at 3 T; neuronal activity across cortical layers was mapped using the Fos expression technique. Results show that BOLD response is weighted by blood volume and that pixels with high BOLD response can be located at the cortical surface or in deep layers, depending on local vasculature. In contrast to BOLD response, the pixels with high CBV response were consistently clustered in the deep cortical layers. Percentage-CBV change in cortical layers IV-V was 7.3 ± 1.5%, which was significantly higher than in layers I-III (4.1 ± 0.9%) and VI (4.3 ± 0.7%) (mean ± SEM). The laminar distribution of CBV response correlates well with neuronal activity localized by Fos expression. We conclude that neuronal activity can be inferred from CBV fMRI data with high spatial accuracy.

  abstract = {Summary Simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural activity and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in primary visual cortex of anesthetized monkeys demonstrated varying degrees of correlation between fMRI signals and the different types of neural activity, such as local field potentials (LFPs), multiple-unit activity (MUA), and single-unit activity (SUA). One important question raised by the aforementioned investigation is whether the reported correlations also apply to alert subjects. Monkeys were trained to perform a fixation task while stimuli within the receptive field of each recording site were used to elicit neural responses followed by a BOLD response. We show - also in alert behaving monkeys - that although both LFP and MUA make significant contributions to the BOLD response, LFPs are better and more reliable predictors of the BOLD signal. Moreover, when MUA responses adapt but LFP remains unaffected, the BOLD signal remains unaltered. The persistent coupling of the BOLD signal to the field potential when LFP and MUA have different time evolutions suggests that BOLD is primarily determined by the local processing of inputs in a given cortical area. In the alert animal the largest portion of the BOLD signal's variance is explained by an LFP range (20-60 Hz) that is most likely related to neuromodulation. Finally, the similarity of the results in alert and anesthetized subjects indicates that at least in V1 anesthesia is not a confounding factor. This enables the comparison of human fMRI results with a plethora of electrophysiological results obtained in alert or anesthetized animals.},

  abstract = {Abstract There is a growing appreciation of the importance of nonlinearities in evoked responses in fMRI, particularly with the advent of event-related fMRI. These nonlinearities are commonly expressed as interactions among stimuli that can lead to the suppression and increased latency of responses to a stimulus that are incurred by a preceding stimulus. We have presented previously a model-free characterization of these effects using generic techniques from nonlinear system identification, namely a Volterra series formulation. At the same time Buxton et al. (1998) described a plausible and compelling dynamical model of hemodynamic signal transduction in fMRI. Subsequent work by Mandeville et al. (1999) provided important theoretical and empirical constraints on the form of the dynamic relationship between blood flow and volume that underpins the evolution of the fMRI signal. In this paper we combine these system identification and model-based approaches and ask whether the Balloon model is sufficient to account for the nonlinear behaviors observed in real time series. We conclude that it can, and furthermore the model parameters that ensue are biologically plausible. This conclusion is based on the observation that the Balloon model can produce Volterra kernels that emulate empirical kernels. To enable this evaluation we had to embed the Balloon model in a hemodynamic input-state-output model that included the dynamics of perfusion changes that are contingent on underlying synaptic activation. This paper presents (i) the full hemodynamic model (ii), how its associated Volterra kernels can be derived, and (iii) addresses the model's validity in relation to empirical nonlinear characterisations of evoked responses in fMRI and other neurophysiological constraints.},

  abstract = {The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80% of brain mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and nonneuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically-built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain.},

SE-EPI offers improved spatial specificity, since signal changes originate from the microvasculature, but its lower functional sensitivity has limited the usage of this sequence in fMRI experiments. Differential fMRI paradigms, in which two closely matched stimulus conditions are used, can suppress the contribution from veins, thus also offering improved spatial specificity compared to conventional block or event-related designs with long "rest" periods. In this study, we employed a differential fMRI paradigm to stimulate bands of primary visual cortex with pre-defined widths by using visual stimuli comprised of complementary rings of contrast-reversing checkerboard patterns (8 Hz). This paradigm was used to investigate the spatial specificity of GE and SE-BOLD contrast at 7T. Results show that the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) is larger for GE-EPI data than for the SE-EPI data for band widths in the range 1.7-6.6 mm, however as the width of the band decreases the CNR for GE and SE sequences converges. These results suggest that when using a differential mapping paradigm, GE-BOLD contrast is better for studying functional features that are larger than ~1.5 mm in size.},

  abstract = {Abstract Gradient and spin echo (GRE and SE, respectively) weighted magnetic resonance images report on neuronal activity via changes in deoxygenated hemoglobin content and cerebral blood volume induced by alterations in neuronal activity. Hence, vasculature plays a critical role in these functional signals. However, how the different blood vessels (e.g. arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins) quantitatively contribute to the functional MRI (fMRI) signals at each field strength, and consequently, how spatially specific these MRI signals are remain a source of discussion. In this study, we utilize an integrative model of the fMRI signals up to 16.4 T, exploiting the increasing body of published information on relevant physiological parameters. Through simulations, extra- and intravascular functional signal contributions were determined as a function of field strength, echo time (TE) and MRI sequence used. The model predicted previously reported effects, such as feasibility of optimization of SE but not the GRE approach to yield larger micro-vascular compared to macro-vascular weighting. In addition, however, micro-vascular effects were found to peak with increasing magnetic fields even in the SE approach, and further increases in magnetic fields imparted no additional benefits besides beyond the inherent signal-to-noise (SNR) gains. Furthermore, for SE, using a TE larger than the tissue T2 enhances micro-vasculature signal relatively, though compromising SNR for spatial specificity. In addition, the intravascular SE MRI signals do not fully disappear even at high field strength as arteriolar and capillary contributions persist. The model, and the physiological considerations presented here can also be applied in contrast agent experiments and to other models, such as calibrated BOLD approach and vessel size imaging.},

  abstract = {Abstract Since the commencement of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), great effort has been put into increasing its spatial resolution and signal specificity from vessel-weighted to more tissue-specific signals. The working assumption is that the “tissue” signals closely mirror changes at the neuronal level. While great progress has been made, the basic and most fundamental questions remain unanswered: where in the gray matter do these “tissue fMRI” changes occur? Recently, the temporal correspondence of hemodynamic-based fMRI signals and neurophysiological activity was explored. The data suggest, although not conclusively, that the local field potential (LFP) response gives a better estimate of changes that accompany increased neuronal activity. LFP are thought to be generated by synaptic activity reflecting input signals into layer IV within a cortical region. If so, the spatial distribution of the fMRI signal should be specific to the corresponding cortical lamina. Here, in a combined imaging and histological study, the spatial characteristics of fMRI signals across the lamina were explored. In a high-resolution fMRI study (0.15 × 0.15 × 2 mm3), the spatial specificity of fMRI signals was correlated with the underlying cortical laminar cytoarchitectonic obtained within the same animal and tissue region. We demonstrate that when surface vessels are excluded high-resolution fMRI signals peak at cortical layer IV.},

  abstract = {Abstract The lamination of mammalian neocortex is widely used as reference for describing a wide range of anatomical and physiological data. Its value lies in the observation that in all examined species, cortical afferents, intrinsic cells and projection neurons organize themselves with respect to the laminae. The comprehension of the computations, carried out by the neocortical microcircuits, critically relies on the study of the interlaminar connectivity patterns and the intralaminar physiological processes in vivo. High-resolution functional neuroimaging, enabling the visualization of activity in individual cortical laminae or columns, may greatly contribute in such studies. Yet, the BOLD effect, as measured with the commonly used GE-EPI, contains contributions from both macroscopic venous blood vessels and capillaries. The low density of the cortical veins limits the effective spatial specificity of the fMRI signal and yields maps that are weighted toward the macrovasculature, which thus can be significantly different from the actual site of increased neuronal activity. Spin-echo (SE) sequences yielding apparent T2-weighted BOLD images have been shown to improve spatial specificity by increasing the sensitivity of the signal to spins of the parenchyma, particularly at high magnetic fields. Here we used SE-fMRI at 4.7 T to examine the specificity and resolution of functional maps obtained by stimulating the primary visual cortex of monkeys. Cortical layers could be clearly visualized, and functional activity was predominantly localized in cortical layer IV/Duvernoy layer 3. The choice of sequence parameters influences the fMRI signal, as the SE-EPI is by nature sensitive to T2* in addition to its T2 dependency. Using parameters that limit T2* effects yielded higher specificity and better visualization of the cortical laminae. Because the demands of high-spatial resolution using SE severely decreases temporal resolution, we used a stimulus protocol that allows sampling at higher effective temporal resolution. This way, it was possible to acquire high-spatial and high-temporal resolution SE-fMRI data.},

However, whether the spatial specificity of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI is sufficiently high to reveal lamina specific organization in the cortex reliably is still unclear. In this study we demonstrate for the first time the detection of such layer-specific activation in awake monkeys at the spatial resolution of 200×200×1000μm3 in a vertical 4.7T scanner. Results collected in trained monkeys are high in contrast-to-noise ratio and low in motion artifacts. Isolation of laminar activation was aided by choosing the optimal slice orientation and thickness using a novel pial vein pattern analysis derived from optical imaging. We found that the percent change of GE-BOLD signal is the highest at a depth corresponding to layer IV. Changes in the middle layers (layer IV) were 30% greater than changes in the top layers (layers I-III), and 32% greater than the bottom layers (layers V/VI). The laminar distribution of BOLD signal correlates well with neural activity reported in the literature. Our results suggest that the high intrinsic spatial resolution of GE-BOLD signal is sufficient for mapping sub-millimeter functional structures in awake monkeys. This degree of spatial specificity will be useful for mapping both laminar activations and columnar structures in the cerebral cortex.},

Feedforward, horizontal and feedback responses largely activate separate layers of a cortical unit, meaning they can be dissociated by lamina-resolved neurophysiological techniques. Such techniques are invasive and are therefore rarely used in humans. However, recent developments in high spatial resolution fMRI allow for non-invasive, in vivo measurements of brain responses specific to separate cortical layers. This provides an important opportunity to dissociate between feedforward and feedback brain responses, and investigate communication between brain areas at a more fine- grained level than previously possible in the human species. In this review, we highlight recent studies that successfully used laminar fMRI to isolate layer-specific feedback responses in human sensory cortex. In addition, we review several areas of cognitive neuroscience that stand to benefit from this new technological development, highlighting contemporary hypotheses that yield testable predictions for laminar fMRI. We hope to encourage researchers with the opportunity to embrace this development in fMRI research, as we expect that many future advancements in our current understanding of human brain function will be gained from measuring lamina-specific brain responses.},

The remainder form synapses with dendritic shafts. The synapses found on spines were often more complex, perforated postsynaptic densities than those found on dendritic shafts. The reciprocal projection from V2 to V1 targeted layers 1, 2/3, and 5 and was formed of axons of different morphologies. One axon type, originating from superficial layer pyramidal cells, had a morphology resembling those of local pyramidal cell collaterals. These axons arborized in layers 1, 2/3, and 5 of V1. Another type of axon, arborizing in layer 1, was slender (0.3 μm), unbranched, unmyelinated, and uniformly covered with boutons terminaux and formed asymmetric synapses mainly with slender spines. Yet a third type of axon also confined to layer 1, was thick (&amp;gt;1 μm), branched, heavily myelinated, and formed separate small clusters of large (∼1 μm) en passant multisynaptic boutons that formed asymmetric synapses mainly with large flat spines.

  abstract = {Abstract Functional MRI using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast indirectly probes neuronal activity via evoked cerebral blood volume (CBV) and oxygenation changes. Thus, its spatio-temporal characteristics are determined by vascular physiology and MRI parameters. In this paper, we focus on the spatial distribution and time course of the fMRI signal and their magnetic field strength dependence. Even though much is still unknown, the following consistent picture is emerging: a) For high spatial resolution imaging, fMRI contrast-to-noise increases supra-linearly with field strength. b) The location and spacing of penetrating arteries and ascending veins in the cortical tissue are not correlated to cortical columns, imposing limitations on achievable point-spread function (PSF) in fMRI. c) Baseline CBV distribution may vary over cortical layers biasing fMRI signal to layers with high CBV values. d) The largest CBV change is in the tissue microvasculature, less in surface arteries and even less in pial veins. e) Venous CBV changes are only relevant for longer stimuli, and oxygenation changes are largest in post-capillary blood vessels. f) The balloon effect (i.e. slow recovery of CBV to baseline) is located in the tissue, consistent with the fact that the post-stimulus undershoot has narrower spatial PSF than the positive BOLD response. g) The onset time following stimulation has been found to be shortest in middle/lower layers, both in optical imaging and high-resolution fMRI, but we argue and demonstrate with simulations that varying signal latencies can also be caused by vascular properties and, therefore, may potentially not be interpreted as neural latencies. With simulations, we illustrate the field strength dependency of fMRI signal transients, such as the adaptation during stimulation, initial dip and the post-stimulus undershoot. In sum, vascular structure and function impose limitations on the achievable PSF of fMRI and give rise to complex fMRI transients, which contain time-varying amount of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal information. Nevertheless, non-invasive fMRI at ultra-high magnetic fields not only provides high contrast-to-noise but also an unprecedented detailed view on cognitive processes in the human brain.},

In principle, this would enable the study of layered cortical circuits, one of the fundaments of cortical computation. However, the spatial layout of cortical blood supply may become an important confound at such high resolution. In particular, venous blood draining back to the cortical surface perpendicularly to the layered structure is expected to influence the measured responses in different layers. Here, we present an extension of a hemodynamic model commonly used for analyzing fMRI data (in dynamic causal models or biophysical network models) that accounts for such blood draining effects by coupling local hemodynamics across layers. We illustrate the properties of the model and its inversion by a series of simulations and show that it successfully captures layered fMRI data obtained during a simple visual experiment. We conclude that for future studies of the dynamics of layered neuronal circuits with high-resolution fMRI, it will be pivotal to include effects of blood draining, particularly when trying to infer on the layer-specific connections in cortex -- a theme of key relevance for brain disorders like schizophrenia and for theories of brain function such as predictive coding.},

  abstract = {One of the most relevant questions regarding the function of the nervous system is how sensory information is represented in populations of cortical neurons. Despite its importance, the manner in which sensory-evoked activity propagates across neocortical layers and columns has yet not been fully characterized. In this study, we took advantage of the distinct organization of the rodent barrel cortex and recorded with multielectrode arrays simultaneously from up to 74 neurons localized in several functionally identified layers and columns of anesthetized adult Wistar rats in vivo. The flow of activity within neuronal populations was characterized by temporally precise spike sequences, which were repeatedly evoked by single-whisker stimulation. The majority of the spike sequences representing instantaneous responses were led by a subgroup of putative inhibitory neurons in the principal column at thalamo-recipient layers, thus revealing the presence of feedforward inhibition. However, later spike sequences were mainly led by infragranular excitatory neurons in neighboring columns. Although the starting point of the sequences was anatomically confined, their ending point was rather scattered, suggesting that the population responses are structurally dispersed. Our data show for the first time the simultaneous intra- and intercolumnar processing of information at high temporal resolution.},

  abstract  = {A major hallmark of cortical organization is the existence of a variable number of layers, i.e., sheets of neurons stacked on top of each other, in which neurons have certain commonalities. However, even for the neocortex, variable numbers of layers have been described and it is just a convention to distinguish six layers from each other. Whether cortical layers are a structural epiphenomenon caused by developmental dynamics or represent a functionally important modularization of cortical computation is still unknown. Here we present our insights from the reeler mutant mouse, a model for a developmental, “molecular lesion”-induced loss of cortical layering that could serve as ground truth of what an intact layering adds to the cortex in terms of functionality. We could demonstrate that the reeler neocortex shows no inversion of cortical layers but rather a severe disorganization that in the primary somatosensory cortex leads to the complete loss of layers. Nevertheless, the somatosensory system is well organized. When exploring an enriched environment with specific sets of whiskers, activity-dependent gene expression takes place in the corresponding modules. Precise whisker stimuli lead to the functional activation of somatotopically organized barrel columns as visualized by intrinsic signal optical imaging. Similar results were obtained in the reeler visual system. When analyzing pathways that could be responsible for preservation of tactile perception, lemniscal thalamic projections were found to be largely intact, despite the smearing of target neurons across the cortical mantle. However, with optogenetic experiments we found evidence for a mild dispersion of thalamic synapse targeting on layer IV-spiny stellate cells, together with a general weakening in thalamocortical input strength. This weakening of thalamic inputs was compensated by intracortical mechanisms involving increased recurrent excitation and/or reduced feedforward inhibition. In conclusion, a layer loss so far only led to the detection of subtle defects in sensory processing by reeler mice. This argues in favor of a view in which cortical layers are not an essential component for basic perception and cognition. A view also supported by recent studies in birds, which can have remarkable cognitive capacities despite the lack of a neocortex with multiple cortical layers. In conclusion, we suggest that future studies directed toward understanding cortical functions should rather focus on circuits specified by functional cell type composition than mere laminar location.},

  abstract  = {Predictive coding theories of sensory brain function interpret the hierarchical construction of the cerebral cortex as a Bayesian, generative model capable of predicting the sensory data consistent with any given percept. Predictions are fed backward in the hierarchy and reciprocated by prediction error in the forward direction, acting to modify the representation of the outside world at increasing levels of abstraction, and so to optimize the nature of perception over a series of iterations. This accounts for many ‘illusory’ instances of perception where what is seen (heard, etc.) is unduly influenced by what is expected, based on past experience. This simple conception, the hierarchical exchange of prediction and prediction error, confronts a rich cortical microcircuitry that is yet to be fully documented. This article presents the view that, in the current state of theory and practice, it is profitable to begin a two-way exchange: that predictive coding theory can support an understanding of cortical microcircuit function, and prompt particular aspects of future investigation, whilst existing knowledge of microcircuitry can, in return, influence theoretical development. As an example, a neural inference arising from the earliest formulations of predictive coding is that the source populations of forward and backward pathways should be completely separate, given their functional distinction; this aspect of circuitry - that neurons with extrinsically bifurcating axons do not project in both directions - has only recently been confirmed. Here, the computational architecture prescribed by a generalized (free-energy) formulation of predictive coding is combined with the classic ‘canonical microcircuit’ and the laminar architecture of hierarchical extrinsic connectivity to produce a template schematic, that is further examined in the light of (a) updates in the microcircuitry of primate visual cortex, and (b) rapid technical advances made possible by transgenic neural engineering in the mouse. The exercise highlights a number of recurring themes, amongst them the consideration of interneuron diversity as a spur to theoretical development and the potential for specifying a pyramidal neuron’s function by its individual ‘connectome,’ combining its extrinsic projection (forward, backward or subcortical) with evaluation of its intrinsic network (e.g., unidirectional versus bidirectional connections with other pyramidal neurons).},

We theorise that the operation of predictive coding in the motor system (a process termed ‘active inference’) provides a principled rationale for the apparent recession of the ascending pathway in motor cortex. The extension of this theory to interlaminar circuitry also accounts for a sub-class of ‘mirror neuron’ in motor cortex - whose activity is suppressed when observing an action -explaining how predictive coding can gate hierarchical processing to switch between perception and action.},

  abstract = {The directionality of corticocortical projections is classified as feedforward (going from a lower to higher hierarchical levels), feedback (interconnecting descending levels), and lateral (interconnecting equivalent levels). Directionality is determined by the combined criteria of the laminar patterns of the axon terminals as well as the cells of origins and has been used to construct models of the visual system, which reveals a strict hierarchical organization (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Hilgetag et al., 1996a). However, these models are indeterminate partly because we have no indication of the distance separating adjacent levels. Here we have attempted to determine a graded parameter describing the anatomical relationship of interconnected areas. We have investigated whether the precise percentage of labeled supragranular layer neurons (SLN%) in each afferent area after injection in either visual areas V1 or V4 determines its hierarchical position in the Felleman and Van Essen (1991) model. This shows that pathway directionality in the Felleman and Van Essen model is characterized by a range of SLN% values. The one exception is the projection of the frontal eye field to area V4, which resembles a feedforward projection. Individual areal differences in SLN% values are highly significant, and the number of hierarchical steps separating a target area from a source area is found to be tightly correlated to SLN%. The present results show that the hierarchical rank of each afferent area is reliably indicated by SLN%, and therefore this constitutes a graded parameter that is related to hierarchical distance.},

In recent years, however, a more proactive attitude to the causality concept has developed among statisticians. On the one hand, there is the school of counterfactual causality directed towards forming a better basis for clinical trials and epidemiology. On the other hand, there is the mechanistic view of causality. These developments are discussed and set into a larger context, where the often ignored role of time is emphasized. An extension of path analysis to stochastic processes is briefly presented. Causality is furthermore discussed in relation to genetic studies and to the emerging field of systems biology. Statisticians should also relate to the philosophical content of causality, especially that found in the foundations of physics.},

In these methods, which include reconstruction from projections, Fourier imaging, spin-warp imaging, and echo-planar imaging, controllable gradient fields determine the points in the spatial-frequency domain which are sampled at any given time during the acquisition of data (the free induction decay, or FID). The detailed time dependence of the resulting trajectory of sample points (the k trajectory) determines the relative weight and accuracy with which image information at each spatial frequency is measured, establishing theoretical limitations on image quality achievable with a given imaging method. We demonstrate here that these considerations may be used to compare the theoretical capabilities of NMR imaging methods, and to derive new imaging methods with optimal theoretical imaging properties.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the role of vascular space occupancy (VASO) MRI, a non-invasive CBV-weighted technique, for evaluating CBV reactivity in patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: VASO reactivity, defined as signal change in response to hypercapnic stimulus (4s exhale, 14s breath hold), was measured in the left and right ICA flow territories in patients (n=10) with varying degrees of unilateral and bilateral ICA stenosis and in healthy volunteers (n=10). RESULTS: Percent VASO reactivity was more negative (P<0.01) bilaterally in patients (ipsilateral: −3.6±1.5%; contralateral: −3.4±1.2%) compared to age-matched controls (left: −1.9±0.6%; right: −1.9±0.8%). Owing to the nature of the VASO contrast mechanism, this more negative VASO reactivity was attributed to autoregulatory CBV effects in patients. A post-breath-hold overshoot, which was absent in healthy-volunteers, was observed unilaterally in a subset of patients. CONCLUSIONS: More negative VASO reactivity was observed in patients with ICA stenosis and may be a marker of autoregulatory effects. Furthermore, the post-breath-hold overshoot observed in patients is consistent with compensatory microvascular vasoconstriction and may be a marker of hemodynamic impairment. Based on the results of this feasibility study, VASO should be useful for identifying CBV adjustments in patients with steno-occlusive disease of the ICA.},

  abstract = {This study examines the value of spin-echo-based fMRI for cognitive studies at the main magnetic field strength of 3 T using a spin-echo EPI (SE-EPI) sequence and a Stroop color-word matching task. SE-EPI has the potential advantage over conventional gradient-echo EPI (GE-EPI) that signal losses caused by dephasing through the slice are not present, and hence although image distortion will be the same as for an equivalent GE-EPI sequence, signal voids will be eliminated. The functional contrast in SE-EPI will be lower than for GE-EPI, as static dephasing effects do not contribute. As an auxiliary experiment interleaved diffusion-weighted and non-diffusion-weighted SE-EPI was performed in the visual cortex to further elucidate the mechanims of functional contrast. In the Stroop experiment activation was detected in all areas previously found using GE-EPI. Additional frontopolar and ventral frontomedian activations were also found, which could not be detected using GE-EPI. The experiments from visual cortex indicated that at 3 T the BOLD signal change has contributions from the extravascular space and larger blood vessels in roughly equal amounts. In comparison with GE-EPI the absence of static dephasing effects would seem to result in a superior intrinsic spatial resolution. In conclusion the sensitivity of SE-EPI at 3 T is sufficient to make it the method of choice for fMR studies that require a high degree of spatial localization or where the requirement is to detect activation in regions affected by strong susceptibility gradients.},

  abstract  = {Functional MRI (fMRI) by means of spin-echo (SE) techniques provides an interesting alternative to gradient-echo methods because the contrast is based primarily on dynamic averaging associated with the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) effect. In this article the contributions from different brain compartments to BOLD signal changes in SE echo planar imaging (EPI) are investigated. To gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that cause the fMRI contrast, two experiments are presented: First, the intravascular contribution is decomposed into two fractions with different regimes of flow by means of diffusion-weighting gradient schemes which are either flow-compensated, or will maximally dephase moving spins. Second, contributions from the intra- and extravascular space are selectively suppressed by combining flow-weighting with additional refocusing pulses. The results indicate two qualitatively different components of flowing blood which contribute to the BOLD contrast and a nearly equal share in functional signal from the intra- and extravascular compartments at TE ≈ 80 ms and 3 T. Combining these results, there is evidence that at least one-half of the functional signal originates from the parenchyma in SE fMRI at 3 T. The authors suggest the use of flow-compensated diffusion weighting for SE fMRI to improve the sensitivity to the parenchyma. Magn Reson Med 52:724-732, 2004. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract  = {Relaxation time measurements at 3.0 T are reported for both gray and white matter in normal human brain. Measurements were made using a 3.0 T Bruker Biospec magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner in normal adults with no clinical evidence of neurological disease. Nineteen subjects, 8 female and 11 male, were studied for T1 and T2 measurements, and 7 males were studied for T*2. Measurements were made using a saturation recovery method for T1, a multiple spin-echo experiment for T2, and a fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence with 14 different echo times for T*2. Results of the measurements are summarized as follows. Average T1 values measured for gray matter and white matter were 1331 and 832 msec, respectively. Average T2 values measured for gray matter and white matter were 80 and 110 msec, respectively. The average T*2 values for occipital and frontal gray matter were 41.6 and 51.8 msec, respectively. Average T*2 values for occipital and frontal white matter were 48.4 and 44.7 msec, respectively. ANOVA tests of the measurements revealed that for both gray and white matter there were no significant differences in T1 from one location in the brain to another. T2 in occipital gray matter was significantly higher (0.0001 < P < .0375) than the rest of the gray matter, while T2 in frontal white matter was significantly lower (P < 0.0001). Statistical analysis of cerebral hemispheric differences in relaxation time measurements showed no significant differences in T1 values from the left hemisphere compared with the right, except in insular gray matter, where this difference was significant at P = 0.0320. No significant difference in T2 values existed between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Significant differences were apparent between male and female relaxation time measurements in brain. J.

In both techniques, phase encoding gradients are applied in the z direction, and three-dimensional k-space is filled by a raster pattern in Cartesian coordinates. Spatial saturation is used to avoid aliasing in the y direction, and a selective pulse is applied to excite the desired slab of tissue and eliminate aliasing in z. The average echo-times, measured from the center of the 90° pulse to the center of the acquisition k-space(kx= kykz = 0), were 45 and 104 ms for single echo and multi-echo methods, respectively.

  abstract = {Ultra-high-field MRI provides large increases in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as enhancement of several contrast mechanisms in both structural and functional imaging. Combined, these gains result in a substantial boost in contrast-to-noise ratio that can be exploited for higher-spatial-resolution imaging to extract finer-scale information about the brain. With increased spatial resolution, however, there is a concurrent increased image-encoding burden that can cause unacceptably long scan times for structural imaging and slow temporal sampling of the hemodynamic response in functional MRI - particularly when whole-brain imaging is desired. To address this issue, new directions of imaging technology development - such as the move from conventional 2D slice-by-slice imaging to more efficient simultaneous multislice (SMS) or multiband imaging (which can be viewed as “pseudo-3D” encoding) as well as full 3D imaging - have provided dramatic improvements in acquisition speed. Such imaging paradigms provide higher SNR efficiency as well as improved encoding efficiency. Moreover, SMS and 3D imaging can make better use of coil sensitivity information in multichannel receiver arrays used for parallel imaging acquisitions through controlled aliasing in multiple spatial directions. This has enabled unprecedented acceleration factors of an order of magnitude or higher in these imaging acquisition schemes, with low image artifact levels and high SNR. Here we review the latest developments of SMS and 3D imaging methods and related technologies at ultra-high field for rapid high-resolution functional and structural imaging of the brain.

Hertz potential is introduced for probe modeling where charge separation cannot be ignored. Using a spherical geometry, the potential from current loops that would produce a homogeneous static B1 field is calculated; at high frequency it is shown to create an unnecessarily inhomogeneous field. However, a totally homogeneous field is shown to be unattainable. Boundary conditions are solved for circularly polarized fields, and strategies for limited shimming of the sample B1 field are then presented. A distinction is drawn between dielectric resonance and spatial field focusing. At high frequency, the region of maximum specific absorption is shown to move inside the sample and decrease. From the fields in both rotating frames, the signal-to-noise ratio is derived and compared with the traditional, low-frequency formulation. On average, it is mostly found to be slightly larger at high frequency. Nevertheless, the free induction decay is sometimes found to be annulled. J. Magn. Reson.

  abstract = {Activation of the rat primary somatosensory barrel field (S1BF) is a commonly used model to study the mechanisms of evoked coupled cortical blood flow changes. However, the relationship between these blood flow changes and variable whisker movement has not been completely characterized. We have previously shown that in urethane anesthetized rats, the magnitude of laser-Doppler measured cortical blood flow changes increase linearly with the frequency of full pad whisker movement over the physiological range of 1.5 to 10.5 s. To further test the hypothesis that local cortical blood flow increases with frequency of whisker movement and underlying neuronal activity, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was determined autoradiographically in seven urethane anesthetized SD rats. Selected rows of whiskers (rows C, D, E) were stimulated at 3 s on the right side of the rat’s face and simultaneously at 10 s on the left side for 2 min prior to radioactive tracer administration. Subregions of somatosensory cortex were identified with the aid of thionin and cytochrome oxidase stained sections. Mean rCBF (ml/100 g/min) for S1BF were: S1BF [0 s] left cortex, 146±13; S1BF [0 s] right cortex, 158±15; S1BF[3 s], 160±13; S1BF [10 s] 178±14. In both stimulated and nonstimulated regions, the profile of blood flow increased across cortex laminae, peaking in layer IV and decreasing through deeper layers. Maximal blood flow increases elicited by whisker movement occurred in cortical layers I-IV. These data support the hypothesis that whisker movement elicited rCBF changes are input frequency dependent and are most pronounced in cortical layers I though IV. These data provide a strong framework in which to study the mechanisms of neuronal activity-blood flow coupling.},

  abstract = {This review provides a summary statement of recommended implementations of arterial spin labeling (ASL) for clinical applications. It is a consensus of the ISMRM Perfusion Study Group and the European ASL in Dementia consortium, both of whom met to reach this consensus in October 2012 in Amsterdam. Although ASL continues to undergo rapid technical development, we believe that current ASL methods are robust and ready to provide useful clinical information, and that a consensus statement on recommended implementations will help the clinical community to adopt a standardized approach. In this review, we describe the major considerations and trade-offs in implementing an ASL protocol and provide specific recommendations for a standard approach. Our conclusion is that as an optimal default implementation, we recommend pseudo-continuous labeling, background suppression, a segmented three-dimensional readout without vascular crushing gradients, and calculation and presentation of both label/control difference images and cerebral blood flow in absolute units using a simplified model.

  abstract  = {We propose a very high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) gradient-echo technique with a twofold parallel imaging acceleration using a specialized occipital receiver coil at 3 T to perform functional MRI (fMRI) of the visual cortex. This configuration makes it possible to acquire 3D fMRI data within a timescale compatible with a block design. Without further processing, the functional maps at an isotropic 3D resolution of 0.42 µL (0.75 mm voxel size) and near-isotropic resolution of 1.2 µL (1 mm voxel size) show very robust activation in visual areas, but with clear contamination from larger veins. As this technique allows direct identification of veins in the functional scan, it permits removal of their effect from the activation maps. In our study, elimination of veins qualitatively improves the spatial specificity of activation maps, while reducing the activated volume by about 25%. The proposed technique provides functional information at the resolution of anatomical scans, is localized to gray matter, and facilitates functional to anatomical co-registration because of minimal distortions.

Optimized pulses were then used within a pulsed ASL sequence to assess the pulses' in vivo inversion efficiencies for ASL. The measured in vivo inversion efficiency was significantly lower than theoretical predictions (e.g., 93% experimental compared to 99% theoretical) for the tangent hyperbolic pulse applied in a background suppression scheme.

  abstract      = {Abstract Purpose: To study the correspondence of anatomically and functionally defined visual areas (primary visual cortex, V1, and motion selective area V5/human MT+) by using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) in vivo at 7 T. Materials and Methods: Four subjects participated in this study. High?resolution (≈0.4 mm isotropic) anatomical MRI was used to identify cortical regions based on their distinct cortical lamination. The optimal contrast for identifying heavily myelinated layers within gray matter was quantitatively assessed by comparing T1?weighted magnetization?prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) and T2*?weighted, 3D fast?low angle shot (FLASH) imaging. Retinotopic mapping was performed using GE?based fMRI at 1.5 mm isotropic resolution to identify functional areas. Results: T2*?weighted FLASH imaging was found to provide a significantly higher contrast?to?noise ratio, allowing visualization of the stria of Gennari in every slice of a volume covering the occipital cortex in each of the four subjects in this study. The independently derived boundary of V1, identified in the same subjects using retinotopic mapping by fMRI, closely matched the border of anatomically defined striate cortex in the human brain. Evidence of banding was also found within the functionally defined V5 area; however, we did not find a good correlation of this area, or the functionally identified subregion (MT), with the banded area. Conclusion: High?resolution T2*?weighted images acquired at 7 T can be used to identify myelinated bands within cortical gray matter in reasonable measurement times. Regions where a myelinated band was identified show a high degree of overlap with the functionally defined V1 area. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2012;287?299. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract      = {In contrast to vision, where retinotopic mapping alone can define areal borders, primary auditory areas such as A1 are best delineated by combining in vivo tonotopic mapping with postmortem cyto- or myeloarchitectonics from the same individual. We combined high-resolution (800 μm) quantitative T1 mapping with phase-encoded tonotopic methods to map primary auditory areas (A1 and R) within the “auditory core” of human volunteers. We first quantitatively characterize the highly myelinated auditory core in terms of shape, area, cortical depth profile, and position, with our data showing considerable correspondence to postmortem myeloarchitectonic studies, both in cross-participant averages and in individuals. The core region contains two “mirror-image” tonotopic maps oriented along the same axis as observed in macaque and owl monkey. We suggest that these two maps within the core are the human analogs of primate auditory areas A1 and R. The core occupies a much smaller portion of tonotopically organized cortex on the superior temporal plane and gyrus than is generally supposed. The multimodal approach to defining the auditory core will facilitate investigations of structure-function relationships, comparative neuroanatomical studies, and promises new biomarkers for diagnosis and clinical studies.},

  abstract      = {Adolescence is a period of human brain growth and high incidence of mental health disorders. Here, we show consistently in two MRI cohorts that human brain changes in adolescence were concentrated on the more densely connected hubs of the connectome (i.e., association cortical regions that mediated efficient connectivity throughout the human brain structural network). Hubs were less myelinated at 14 y but had faster rates of myelination and cortical shrinkage in the 14- to 24-y period. This topologically focused process of cortical consolidation was associated with expression of genes enriched for normal synaptic and myelin-related processes and risk of schizophrenia. Consolidation of anatomical network hubs could be important for normal and clinically disordered adolescent brain development.How does human brain structure mature during adolescence? We used MRI to measure cortical thickness and intracortical myelination in 297 population volunteers aged 14-24 y old. We found and replicated that association cortical areas were thicker and less myelinated than primary cortical areas at 14 y. However, association cortex had faster rates of shrinkage and myelination over the course of adolescence. Age-related increases in cortical myelination were maximized approximately at the internal layer of projection neurons. Adolescent cortical myelination and shrinkage were coupled and specifically associated with a dorsoventrally patterned gene expression profile enriched for synaptic, oligodendroglial- and schizophrenia-related genes. Topologically efficient and biologically expensive hubs of the brain anatomical network had greater rates of shrinkage/myelination and were associated with overexpression of the same transcriptional profile as cortical consolidation. We conclude that normative human brain maturation involves a genetically patterned process of consolidating anatomical network hubs. We argue that developmental variation of this consolidation process may be relevant both to normal cognitive and behavioral changes and the high incidence of schizophrenia during human brain adolescence.},
